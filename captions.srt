00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:53,150
Prologue
Two small pairs of boots echoed on the afternoon

2
00:00:53,150 --> 00:01:00,190
cobblestones—one pair in a sprint, the other
in a stumble and slide. A blond girl, no older

3
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,390
than five, dragged a raven-haired girl an
inch taller and a year older down the sea

4
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,150
lane toward a small cottage.

5
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,670
The dark-haired girl’s lungs were sputtering,
each inhale a failure.

6
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,780
She was drowning on dry land.

7
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,909
As the house came into view, the blond girl
opened her mouth to scream for help but before

8
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,460
any sound could come out, the other girl’s
mother burst through the door. Like she knew

9
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,550
what had happened—she always seemed to know
what they’d done.

10
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,080
“Evie!” the mother cried, cradling her
daughter in a heap at her chest and running

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,140
toward the cottage. “Anna,” she said to
the little blonde, who was panting from carrying

12
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,190
her friend so far, “fetch the royal physician—”

13
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
“But—”

14
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,190
“Go!”

15
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,010
The girl didn’t protest again, fine boots
clacking against the cobblestones as she regained

16
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,010
speed.

17
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,860
When her mother shut the cottage door tightly
behind them, the raven-headed girl knew the

18
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,330
physician’s medicine wouldn’t heal her.

19
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,340
Only one thing would.

20
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,150
“Gianni!” The mother called, and the girl’s
father poked his head out of the bedroom,

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,240
his face slack with the sleep he wasn’t
allowed on his latest whaling trip.

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,480
“Evie . . . what—”

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,820
“A broken rib. Maybe a punctured lung.”
She laid the girl in her bed and ripped the

24
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,230
girl’s bodice to her navel. Blood under
the skin showed black across the expanse of

25
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:35,590
the little girl’s ribs, fissures like spiderwebs
crossed from spine to sternum. The mother

26
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,760
tried to read her daughter’s dark eyes.
“What happened?”

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,209
The girl licked her lips before inhaling just
enough air to speak.

28
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,920
“I saved Nik.”

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,080
That was true. And the little girl was proud.
Daring to smile despite the pain.

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,150
They’d spent the morning together—the
blonde, the raven-haired girl, and their boy—running

31
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,740
through the waves, climbing rocks, dancing
in the sand. But then the afternoon came and

32
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,710
it was time for them to part. The boy sent
back to his castle, the little girls home—the

33
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:19,020
younger one to her mansion, ten times the
size of the other girl’s tiny cottage.

34
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,379
Mischievous and sunburnt, they ran in protest,
the boy leading the way, holding the girls’

35
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,710
hands as they raced across the stepping-stone
rocks that led into the cove. They giggled

36
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,890
and shrieked as they hopped from rock to rock,
the boy’s minder chiding them from the shore.

37
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,710
But one rock was slick with moss. The boy
slipped—falling backward, the base of his

38
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,160
skull aimed directly at a crook of solid stone.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,030
In a blink, the little girl made her choice.

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,470
She threw her body between the boy and the
jagged edge of the rock. Her back took the

41
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:02,580
hit with a huge crack. Her head snapped back,
her skull missing impact by a hair. Just as

42
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,660
she hit, the boy’s head bounced onto the
pilled cotton of her bodice rather than smashing

43
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,540
into the rock.

44
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,420
It was a thing of magic that she’d made
it in time.

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,659
They were caught then. The boy’s minder
yanked them back onto the beach and told them

46
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:23,260
in stern tones to never do that again. Then
the old woman hauled the boy away without

47
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,740
a good-bye, leaving the girls on the sand.

48
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,890
As they turned for home, the little raven-haired
girl stumbled, the shock wearing off and the

49
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:38,949
pain beginning. It radiated up her back, around
her rib cage, to the front of her dress. She

50
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,940
couldn’t catch her breath, each inhale stopping
short. The little blonde said she’d walk

51
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,930
her friend home but by the time they made
it to the sea lane, the raven-headed girl

52
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,080
couldn’t stand, all her weight on the blonde’s
shoulders.

53
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,630
“Oh, Evie . . . ,” the girl’s mother
said. As if she’d seen it all. Immediately,

54
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,850
she sent her husband for her bottles. Her
inks. Not that one. This one. She laid the

55
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,970
girl in her bed and lit a fire with a snap
of her fingers.

56
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,800
And tried every healing spell she knew.

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,500
It only took seconds to know none of them
would work. The girl’s breath withered until

58
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,350
it was almost nothing at all.

59
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:30,050
The mother wept, wishing for her sister—the
strongest witch. Healer of Kings, reviving

60
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,321
those in power who turn a blind eye to magic
when their lives depend on it, but banish

61
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:40,759
it when it doesn’t. She was the reason the
physician might come at all—though he would

62
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:47,470
be too late. As would Hansa, a day away, healing
yet another noble.

63
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,400
The girl’s father pressed his hand into
his wife’s shoulder and wiped away her tears.

64
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,080
Then he squeezed his daughter’s hand, already
growing cold, her circulation failing.

65
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
“I’ll go fetch the minister—”

66
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,821
“Not yet,” the mother said, determination
ringing in her voice. The girl’s mother

67
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:12,850
stood at the edge of the bed, her shoulders
now pin straight, her voice calm and direct.

68
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,259
“There is one more spell I can try.”

69
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:22,660
With gentle fingers, she painted octopus ink
across the little girl’s cheeks, down her

70
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,790
neck, and across her chest. Then her mother
laid her hands gently over the girl’s chest.

71
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,550
“Don’t you worry, Evie.”

72
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,690
The words she said next were old and dark,
and the little girl didn’t understand them.

73
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:43,270
They made her blood crackle like the fire
across the room. Stole the air from the cottage.

74
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,680
Made her mother shake, violently, as she held
her hands to her daughter’s skin.

75
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,220
The little girl couldn’t do anything but
watch her mother, her veins singing. Soon,

76
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,770
her mother’s palms on her skin became more
than damp. They began to burn.

77
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:07,130
And then the pain stopped. Air rushed into
the little girl’s lungs, and her chest rose.

78
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,039
She exhaled, long and deep.

79
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,420
At that the girl’s mother smiled—just
before her own body began to seize, her eyes

80
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,680
rolling back in her head.

81
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,860
It was too much. The mother’s chest compressed,
a long breath pushing out—but no inhale

82
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,360
following.

83
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,860
“Greta! Greta!” The girl’s father placed
his hands on his wife’s face, his palms

84
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,380
burning and flying away, suddenly red.

85
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,350
The prickle in the little girl’s blood spiked
with fear. She struggled to pull herself to

86
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,380
sit, her mother’s hands sliding away as
her form slumped over and her pale cheek smashed

87
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,569
into the bedsheet. The little girl didn’t
hesitate, reaching for her mother’s potions.

88
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:58,389
She turned her mother’s head to face upward
before smearing ink across those pale cheeks,

89
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:04,139
her little fingers blistering with the touch.
Her own skin was pink and warm and full of

90
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,710
life as her mother’s skin turned as white
as snow, as hot as ash.

91
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,250
The girl was smart, though. She’d watched
her mother enough. She knew how these spells

92
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,319
worked. Magic was barter—the right words,
actions, potions for the right result.

93
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,930
She put her hands on her mother’s face and
began repeating those strange words.

94
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,660
Words of life.

95
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:37,309
“Evelyn, no!” Her father didn’t move,
just screamed, fear freezing him to his spot

96
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,739
at the foot of the bed.

97
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:44,149
But the little girl had fumbled her way through
the words enough that her own skin began to

98
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:51,899
grow hot. The pain returned. Her breath became
shallow. Then her mother’s eyes flew open,

99
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,629
showing beautiful hazel instead of the whites.

100
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,769
It was working.

101
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:04,869
Her father looked from his wife to his daughter.
Those words were dark. Old. Powerful. He knew

102
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:08,230
this as much as he knew his native tongue.

103
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:16,110
Her mother’s lips began moving. She took
a deep breath. “Gefa!” With this single

104
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,980
command, she stole the words right from the
little girl’s mouth. Dark words and dark

105
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,160
magic and all sound gone from the girl’s
powerful tongue.

106
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,290
Still, the child kept going, chest heaving—she
was yelling but could not be heard. Tears

107
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,179
as dark as night flowed down her little cheeks.
Black coating her vision, the girl began to

108
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:42,009
wail without sound, her whole body shaking.

109
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:47,720
And, with her last wisp of energy, the girl’s
mother looked to her father.

110
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,010
“Bring Hansa home. Tell her. Promise.”

111
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,420
As he nodded, her mother whispered one last
spell, and the little girl’s screams filled

112
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,230
the air, black tears dripping onto her ruined
dress.

113
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,649
“No, Mama, no!”

114
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,960
The little girl grabbed her mother’s hand,
still burning to the touch, and saw the light

115
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,339
flee from her hazel eyes.

116
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:23,589
1
THE SEA IS A FICKLE WITCH.

117
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,850
She is just as likely to bestow a kiss as
to steal the breath from your lips. Beautiful

118
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,689
and cruel, and every glimmering wrinkle in
between. Filling our bellies and our coffers

119
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:40,350
when she is generous. Coolly watching as we
don black and add tears to her waters when

120
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,899
she is wicked.

121
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:48,040
Only the tide follows her moods—giving and
taking at the same salty rate.

122
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,709
Still, she is more than our witch—she’s
our queen.

123
00:10:53,709 --> 00:11:00,509
In all her spells and tantrums, she is one
of us. The crown jewel of Havnestad, nuzzled

124
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,259
against our shores—for better or worse.

125
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,209
Tonight, dressed in her best party finery,
she appears calm, anger buried well below

126
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:15,550
her brilliant surface. Still, there’s a
charge in the air as the stars wink with the

127
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,630
coming summer solstice and the close of Nik’s
sixteenth birthday.

128
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:27,040
Formally: Crown Prince Asger Niklas Bryniulf
Øldenburg III, first in line to the throne

129
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,379
of the sovereign kingdom of Havnestad.

130
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,709
Informally: just Nik.

131
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:40,209
But “just Nik” isn’t quite right either.
He’s not just anything to me. He’s my

132
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,239
best friend. My only friend, really.

133
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:49,699
And now he’s dancing with Malvina across
the deck of his father’s grand steamship.

134
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:55,689
That is, if you can call her violent tossing
and whirling “dancing.” My stomach lurches

135
00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:00,940
as Nik comes within inches of tipping over
the rail after she forces an overenthusiastic

136
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,759
spin. I wish she’d just give it up.

137
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:12,059
Malvina, formally Komtesse Malvina Christensen,
is a perpetual royal suitor. She and her father

138
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,829
have been vying for King Asger’s attention
for years, hoping he will make the match.

139
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:21,929
Yet despite Nik’s good-natured patience
for her dancing, I have my doubts there will

140
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,699
be a royal wedding in their future.

141
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:29,329
I want to look away from the pink silk blur
of Malvina, but Nik’s eyes are begging me

142
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:37,730
to rescue him. Pleading. Silently calling
my name across the distance—Evvvvvvieee.

143
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,009
I am the only one who can save him. Every
youth in town is here, but no one else can

144
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:49,749
cut in on a girl like Malvina. For the others,
there would be consequences—lost invitations

145
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:54,970
to galas, the oldest horse on the weekend
hunt, a seat at the table next to one’s

146
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,440
senile great-tante instead of the Komtesse.
For me, there are none of those things. You

147
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,929
can’t fall far in society if you’re not
part of it to begin with.

148
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,790
After another aggressive turn, I finally stride
onto the makeshift dance floor, ignoring a

149
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,170
chorus of smirks as I go—they’ve seen
this play before. Malvina will be the victim,

150
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,739
I’ll be the villain, and Nik will let it
happen. It can be a messy business, being

151
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:27,170
the crown prince’s confidante; enduring
small humiliations is only a fraction of the

152
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:33,059
cost. But I won’t apologize for helping
him. We all make compromises in friendships,

153
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,209
and having Nik’s loyalty when no one else
will even look me in the eye is worth every

154
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,980
criticism I face.

155
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,680
I tap the girl on one sturdy shoulder, screw
my face into exaggerated panic, and point

156
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,420
to the eight-layered, blue-sugar-spackled
monstrosity she insisted on crafting.

157
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,899
“Oh, angels, Evie! What is it?” Malvina
barks.

158
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,019
“The cake’s icing—”

159
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:04,799
“Fondant,” she corrects, as if I’ve
spit on her oma’s grave.

160
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,689
“The fondant—it’s bulging.”

161
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:12,019
True panic colors her features as her feet
refuse to move. Torn between dancing with

162
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:18,489
Nik and rescuing her masterpiece from a bulbous
fate, her eyes skip to my face for a moment,

163
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:23,540
incredulous. She fears I’ve purposely stolen
her turn. It’s just the sort of thing the

164
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,959
girls of Havnestad think I would do—the
ones whispering in the shadows about us now.

165
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,370
Except in this case, they’re right.

166
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:39,369
“Do your duty, Malvina. It was lovely dancing
with you.” Nik bends into a slight bow,

167
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:44,649
royal manners on display, not a hint of displeasure
in his features.

168
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:50,420
When his eyes cut away, Malvina sneaks a glare
my way, her disdain for me as clear as her

169
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,600
worry that I’m actually telling the truth.
She doesn’t need to say what she’s thinking,

170
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,319
and she won’t—not if she ever wants to
dance with Nik again. So, when Nik completes

171
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:05,829
his bow, she simply plasters on a trained
smile and leaves him with the most perfect

172
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:10,819
curtsy before running off in a rush of golden
hair and intent.

173
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:16,519
Now Nik bows deeply to me as if I’m his
newest suitor, his mop of black hair briefly

174
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,980
obscuring his coal-dark eyes. “May I have
the remainder of this dance, my lady?”

175
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:31,111
My lips curl into a smile as my legs automatically
dip into a polite curtsy. My lady. Despite

176
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:36,970
how good those words feel, they’re enough
to earn me the ire of everyone on this boat.

177
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,861
To them I am just the royal fisherman’s
daughter abusing the prince’s kindness,

178
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:47,189
using him for his station. They won’t believe
we’re just friends, as we’ve always been,

179
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:52,720
since we were in diapers. Before I knew what
I was and he knew who he was meant to be.

180
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,569
“But of course, Crown Prince Niklas,”
I reply.

181
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:04,139
He meets my eyes, and we both burst out laughing.
Formality has never worn well between us—regardless

182
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,850
of Nik’s training.

183
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,439
We settle in and begin to waltz across the
deck. He has a good foot on me, but he’s

184
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:17,350
practiced at leaning in—whispers are often
our most convenient language.

185
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,480
“Took you long enough,” he says, twirling
me through the last bars of the song.

186
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,220
“I wanted to see how long you’d stay dry.”

187
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,119
He gasps with false horror in my ear, a smile
tingeing it. “You’d send your own best

188
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:35,149
friend swimming with the mermaids on his birthday?”

189
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,160
“I hear they’re beautiful—not a bad
present for a teenage boy.”

190
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,049
“They also prefer their presents not breathing.”

191
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:49,509
My eyes shoot to his. I can feel the slightest
tremble in my jaw. Today would’ve been our

192
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:55,319
friend Anna’s birthday too. It still is,
though she is no longer here to celebrate

193
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:00,889
it. She was exactly a year younger than Nik.
We’d each had our share of close calls in

194
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:07,059
those days, the great and powerful goddess
Urda seeming to want us all for herself. But

195
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:13,449
we lost Anna. I glance down, feeling tears
hot against my lash line, even after four

196
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:20,540
years’ time. Nik sighs and tugs a curl off
my face. He waits until I finally glance up.

197
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,519
There’s a soft smile riding his lips, and
I know he regrets pulling us from a place

198
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,190
of joy to one so fraught. “Well, thank you
for saving me, Evie. As always.”

199
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:37,570
It’s as good a subject change as any, but
it’s not enough—and we both know it. I

200
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:43,510
take a deep breath and look over Nik’s shoulder,
not trusting myself to say more. I swallow

201
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,970
and try to concentrate on the party. Everything
here has been borrowed for Nik’s celebration—the

202
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,740
ship, the free-flowing hvidtøl, the band,
two servants, and a coal man—and it’s

203
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,139
beautiful. I focus on the miniature lanterns
ringing the deck, the golden thread of my

204
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:03,340
single fancy dress catching their glow.

205
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,610
Suddenly, Malvina hoists herself onto the
dessert table, still frantically trying to

206
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,210
control the cake’s growing bulge. I expect
Nik to laugh, or at least knock out a very

207
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,370
royal snort, but instead he’s looking over
my shoulder, portside, at the sea. I follow

208
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,850
his eyes, and my heart sputters to a stop
when I make out a swift schooner, the familiar

209
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,590
line of a boy—a man—adjusting the sail.

210
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,289
“Iker . . .” His name falls from my lips
in a sigh before I can catch it. I meet Nik’s

211
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,370
eyes, a blush crawling up my cheeks. “I
didn’t know he was coming.”

212
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,130
“Neither did I.” He shrugs and raises
a brow. “But Iker’s not exactly one to

213
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,639
confirm an invitation. Missed that day at
prince school. The lecture about being on

214
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:53,649
time, too.”

215
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,679
“I believe it’s called ‘fashionably
late,’” I say.

216
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,760
“Yes, well, I suppose I wouldn’t know,”
Nik says with a laugh.

217
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,769
The little schooner closes in, and I see that
it’s only Iker—he hasn’t brought a crew

218
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:13,299
with him from Rigeby Bay, not that I’d expect
him to. He’s a weather-worn fisherman trapped

219
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:19,360
in a life designed for silk and caviar. He
redirects the mainsail perfectly, his muscles

220
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,789
tensing tightly as he aims straight for his
cousin’s form.

221
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,460
Nik leans to my ear. “There goes my dancing
partner.”

222
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,820
I punch him on the arm. “You don’t know
that.”

223
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,000
“True, but I do know how you’ve looked
at him since my cake had about ten fewer candles

224
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
on it.”

225
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,759
I roll my eyes, but I can’t help a smile
creeping up my lips. He’s somewhat right,

226
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,659
though now isn’t the best time to argue
that the way I looked at Iker changed from

227
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:53,889
brotherly to something else entirely about
four years ago, not ten.

228
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:59,030
I clear my throat. “I’m sure Malvina won’t
mind—she’s almost finished with your cake,”

229
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,330
I say, nodding in the direction of the blue
monstrosity but never taking my eyes off Iker

230
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,610
as he readies to throw up a line to the steamer.

231
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,139
Nik hugs me close and dips down to my ear.
“You’re such a ravishingly loyal friend.”

232
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:16,870
“Always have been. Always will be.”

233
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,409
“’Tis true.” Nik grins before waving
a long arm above his head. “Well, if it

234
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:25,000
isn’t the crown prince of Rigeby Bay!”

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,009
“And here I hoped to surprise you,” Iker
says, laughing. “Can’t surprise a lighthouse

236
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,870
of a man on his own boat, I suppose.”

237
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:39,409
Nik laughs, standing even taller. “Not if
I’m turned the right way.”

238
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:44,900
Iker laughs even deeper. There is salt in
his hair and few days’ worth of scruff lining

239
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,370
his strong jawline, but he strides across
his deck with the elegance of a prince. He

240
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:55,190
glances up at me, his eyes briefly betraying
a hint of doubt about the sturdiness of my

241
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,679
frame, but tosses the line to me anyway. I
catch it, securing it with a knot I learned

242
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:01,690
from Father.

243
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,919
Iker hauls himself up the rope and onto the
ship. He manages to land on the small patch

244
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,379
of deck just between Nik and myself. Behind
us a crowd has gathered.

245
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:17,480
“Happy birthday, Cousin.” Eyes laughing,
Iker claps Nik on the back and brings him

246
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,590
in for a hug, his toned arms fully encasing
Nik’s spindly-yet-strong form.

247
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,990
When they release, Iker’s eyes go right
to me. They’re the clearest of blues—like

248
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,850
ancient ice in the fjords of the north.

249
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:38,570
“Evelyn,” he says, still retaining an
air of formality from his upbringing, but

250
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,690
he then shockingly pulls me into a hug.

251
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:48,640
I freeze, eyes on Nik as he and everyone else
on the ship stares. Iker doesn’t seem to

252
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,450
notice or care and pulls me tighter, his arms
wrapped around my waist. Warm from ship work,

253
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,320
he smells of salt and limes. His shirt is
freckled with water droplets, onyx on the

254
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,750
starched gray fabric—the sea leaving her
mark.

255
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:11,331
When the moment is over and he lets me go,
an arm lingers across my shoulders. I try

256
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:16,610
to ignore the question nagging me, the one
I’m sure everyone else is asking too. Why

257
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,629
me? We’ve known each other since we were
children, but he’s never shown me this kind

258
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:29,210
of affection before. I’m not his type. I’m
not anyone’s type. Yet Iker continues to

259
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:35,279
act as if it’s all completely normal. He
turns to Nik, to the crowd, and grins that

260
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,080
perfect smile.

261
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,929
“Good people of Havnestad,” he says, his
voice commanding yet sincere. Then the grin

262
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:51,210
grows wider. “Let’s give the prince a
celebration so hearty, he’ll never forget

263
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,169
it.”

264
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:59,879
2
I FEEL AS IF I’M LIVING IN A DREAM.

265
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:05,470
Still warm from Iker’s strong embrace, I
twirl across the dance floor in his arms.

266
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,029
I tried to tell Iker we shouldn’t, but he
wouldn’t hear of it. “Let them talk,”

267
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:15,390
Iker said. If only he knew how much they already
did.

268
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,679
I can sense Malvina’s eyes following me.
Yes, Malvina, this is what it looks like when

269
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,200
someone dances without fearing for his life.
But I try not to think about her. I want to

270
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,530
remember this moment, even the smallest details.
Everything about him wears like oiled leather

271
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:38,320
and loved muslin. His hands are rough and
worn from the sea, and yet they are gentle,

272
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,929
his thumb delicately caressing mine.

273
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,520
My twelve-year-old fantasies were never this
detailed—hardly anything beyond me in a

274
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,690
grand purple gown and Iker in his royal finery
hand-in-hand on a stroll through the palace

275
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:59,629
gardens. The reality is so different, so intense,
and I’m not sure I’m handling it well.

276
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:05,970
I know I’m not. Can he feel my palms sweating?
My heart beating loudly against his chest?

277
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:12,269
“I saw you from my deck, you know,” he
whispers in my ear. “Before coming aboard.

278
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:17,429
You’ve never looked more beautiful, Evie.
And I’ve never begged the gods to steer

279
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,700
my ship faster.”

280
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,530
I don’t know what to say, my voice seizing
in my throat. I look around instead, trying

281
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:31,799
to organize my thoughts. The sun has completely
set, the last strands of light gone with our

282
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,510
plates in a rush and clatter of tiny quail
bones, torsk tails, pea pods, and strawberry

283
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,830
hulls. And though the entire ship deck is
still lit by a ring of miniature lanterns,

284
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,559
the remaining shadow is enough that it almost
feels as if we’re alone.

285
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,640
Just a boy, a girl, and the sea.

286
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,330
The song ends and he hugs me tight. When he
pulls back, he runs his fingers along my jawbone.

287
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,309
“I shouldn’t have stayed away from Havnestad
so long,” he says, capturing one of my curls

288
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:09,510
between his fingers. “You have the same
hair you did as a child.” His gaze lifts

289
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,030
to mine. “The same starry-night eyes.”

290
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,769
I struggle not to look down—down to where
he’s still wound a lock of my hair lightly

291
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:25,470
between his fingers. I bite my lip to silence
the sigh there. His fingers wind tighter around

292
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:31,049
the curl. It almost seems as if he doesn’t
know he’s doing it—this boy made of smiles

293
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,799
and grand gestures doing something so small
it’s escaped him.

294
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,030
Iker’s eyes drift to the band members who
have circled around a bench where someone

295
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,870
has begun to play a guitaren. Though we can’t
see him, the shiny, precise plucks are a dead

296
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,389
giveaway that the musician is Nik. He’s
always been the kind to pick up any instrument

297
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:55,879
and immediately know exactly how to play it,
ever since we were children. He’s strumming

298
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:59,789
the song I used to sing on the docks as a
girl to wish my father safe travels on his

299
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:04,020
fishing trips. Nik said it always got stuck
in his head.

300
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,549
Iker drops the curl.

301
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:07,549
Clears his throat.

302
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:11,340
Adjusts his body so that we’re not touching
in so many places.

303
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:19,309
It’s over. I know it. Perhaps fantasies
are only meant to come true for a moment.

304
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,669
Surely a trick of the gods.

305
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:27,280
His eyes linger on the band when he eventually
speaks, but his tone has changed. “Evie,

306
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,360
I love visiting Havnestad, but I don’t like
to step on my cousin’s toes.”

307
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:40,660
Now my voice isn’t right. Why did Nik have
to play that song? I swallow. “But you aren’t,”

308
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,409
I say, hoping he can’t hear the pleading
in my tone. “Besides, I don’t think Nik

309
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:50,900
would mind seeing more of you, and there is
the Lithasblot festival coming up in a few

310
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
days.”

311
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,559
“Ah, yes, when you people go nuts for Urda,
throw bread at anyone without a double chin,

312
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,960
and run in circles until you pass out.”

313
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,789
“You people?” I say and give him a jab.
Iker may be from across the strait, but he’s

314
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:12,679
just as much an Øldenburg as Nik. Their family
has ruled Denmark and Sweden for four hundred

315
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,090
years. They know better than anyone not to
discount the harvest the goddess has bestowed

316
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,160
on us. “Don’t poke fun at the games. We
take them very seriously.”

317
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,279
“Oh yes, a life-or-death game of carrying
around the heaviest rock.”

318
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:32,879
“Or running the length of a log. All useful
skills.” I laugh, happy to have lightened

319
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:34,130
the mood again.

320
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:40,970
Iker turns to me. “If I stay for this Lithasblot
extravaganza, you must promise you will scramble

321
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,360
across some recently murdered tree for my
entertainment.”

322
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:51,860
“If that’s what it takes, then I promise,”
I say, dipping in a mock curtsy.

323
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,390
A laugh escapes from my lips, but Iker’s
attention is locked on my face. Almost as

324
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:03,399
if he can’t help himself, his thumb grazes
my cheekbone again, down my jaw and to my

325
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:08,620
mouth. The touch of his finger to my lips
sends color rising in my cheeks as I meet

326
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,909
the glacier blue of his eyes.

327
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:12,559
“Iker, I—”

328
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,309
“Gooooooood people of Havnestad!” Our
heads whip around as Nik’s voice booms across

329
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:24,149
the length of the ship. He is still holding
the guitaren, but now he has a crown fashioned

330
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:29,679
of lemon wedges squashed on his wavy flop
of hair. There’s a huge smile tugging at

331
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,799
his cheeks, and his long arms are thrust high
into the air. He’s actually doing quite

332
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,049
the unintentional impression of Iker, though
only after a few mugs of King Asger’s special

333
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:47,070
brew. “As your crown prince, I hereby issue
a royal decree that we sing for me on this,

334
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,770
the sixteenth year of my life.”

335
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,370
“Hear, HEAR,” yells Iker, followed by
the rest of the crowd, which has suddenly

336
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,200
crept back into the corners of my vision.

337
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,899
“Excellent. Ruyven has sent the signal for
fireworks. But first, a so—” Nik’s voice

338
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:09,169
cuts out as Malvina’s strong hand jerks
him down so her lips can meet his ear. The

339
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:15,019
other hand is gesturing behind them, toward
the cake. Nik stands back up slowly and resets

340
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:22,429
the guitaren. “The lovely lady Malvina has
informed me we are at a loss for candles.”

341
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:27,720
Nik points the instrument’s neck at me,
feigned formality still thick in his throat.

342
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,750
“Evelyn?” He raises a brow.

343
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,549
I raise one back.

344
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,330
“Come on, I know you know where they are.”

345
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,749
And I do. Exactly where Nik left them when
he “borrowed” the king’s boat for the

346
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:44,370
first warm day after a long, ice-filled winter.

347
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,640
“Yes, I do, good prince.”

348
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,710
As much as I don’t want to leave Iker’s
side, I step away, the warmth of him clinging

349
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,399
to my skin for a ghost of a second as we separate.
I snag a lantern that’s dipped low on the

350
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,820
line ringing the deck and move away from the
crowd.

351
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:08,000
Boots clomping on the stairs, I disappear
belowdecks to the captain’s quarters. The

352
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,399
space is much larger than something that should
be a captain’s anything—the whole place

353
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,591
is nearly bigger than the home I share with
Father and Tante Hansa. The miniature lantern

354
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:23,760
struggles to keep up with the vastness, illuminating
a halo barely beyond the hem of my party dress.

355
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,220
It’s utterly annoying.

356
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:32,529
Glancing up the stairs, I confirm that I am
alone; no one followed me below. My back to

357
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:38,480
the door, I reach a hand into the lantern.
Softly muttered words of old fall from my

358
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:48,020
lips as my fingers pinch the tip of the candle.
“Brenna bjartr aldrnari. Brenna bjartr aldrari.

359
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,880
Pakka Glöð.”

360
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,970
The candle begins to glow with the full force
of one three times its size.

361
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,980
It’s a small act—something so subtle I
probably could’ve done it in full view of

362
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:07,799
everyone above. But even something as run-of-the-mill
as a strengthening spell is dangerous here.

363
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,630
Women burned for far less under the Øldenburgs
of yesteryear.

364
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,159
My relatives burned for far less.

365
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,369
Which means there are things about me Nik
and Iker can never know.

366
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:25,009
Besides, I already took a risk tonight when
I silently urged Malvina’s cake to shed

367
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,710
its sugary skin. I hadn’t tried something
like that since I was a child, but it worked

368
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,880
well enough. Strengthening the candle in the
open would have been pushing my luck, though,

369
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,789
and I’ve never had much of that to begin
with.

370
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:43,600
Now the cushion of light is more than enough.
I ease my way through the vast space and toward

371
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,759
the pair of chairs under one of the starboard
portholes, a chessboard painted into the oak

372
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,179
table between them.

373
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:55,049
I’d watched Nik stuff the ship’s allotment
of extra candles into the table’s drawer

374
00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:00,139
while helping him clean up evidence of his
warm-weather get-together. Not that his father

375
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:05,460
wouldn’t know about our little celebration—dishonesty
has never sat well in Nik’s royal mind—he

376
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,570
just hadn’t wanted to leave the castle’s
harbor crew with more work.

377
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,690
With rescued candles and matches in hand,
I grab the lantern and spin toward the door.

378
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:21,879
But suddenly in my peripheral vision, I catch
two flashes of shocking white and blue. I

379
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:26,769
spin back around to where a small halo of
light beacons through the porthole.

380
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:32,299
My heart sputters to a dead halt as I realize
I don’t know of any fish with markings like

381
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:33,860
those.

382
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,759
Like human eyes.

383
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,950
Lungs aching for me to remember how to breathe,
I raise the lantern to the porthole, my mind

384
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,610
churning to account for everyone onboard the
ship. Yes, everyone had been there when I

385
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,299
descended the stairs.

386
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:56,410
Yet, when the halo of light reaches the thick
glass, a friend’s eyes are there, deep blue

387
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:03,210
and framed by luminous skin, water-darkened
blond waves, and a look of surprise on parted

388
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,240
lips.

389
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,269
“Anna?”

390
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:11,779
But in the instant I say her name into the
damp cabin, the face vanishes, and I’m left

391
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:14,370
staring into the indigo deep.

392
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,909
My lungs release and draw in a huge gulp of
air as I race to the next porthole, my breath

393
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,740
coming in rapid spurts as I repeat her name.
But there’s no sign of her beautiful face

394
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,239
at that porthole or the next two.

395
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:34,070
I stand in the middle of the king’s great
cabin, heart pounding, breath burning in my

396
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:40,820
lungs, as a heavy sob escapes my lips. Tears
sting my eyes as I realize that even with

397
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,960
Nik’s brotherly friendship and Iker’s
new affection, I’m still just a lonely fisherman’s

398
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
daughter.

399
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,430
A lonely fisherman’s daughter wishing that
I could have my sweet friend back. Wishing

400
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,690
hard enough that I’m seeing ghosts.

401
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:03,210
Wishing so very hard that I’m losing my
mind.

402
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,541
3
I WIPE MY EYES WITH MY WRIST, THE CANDLES

403
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:15,190
AND matches still clutched in my fingers.
A couple of deep breaths, and I will myself

404
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,349
through the door and up the stairs, my legs
leaden.

405
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:26,490
“The good lady has returned with the candles!”
Nik shouts when he sees me, his voice half-singing

406
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,389
in tune with the guitaren.

407
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:34,889
“And the matches, my prince,” I hear myself
say in a much steadier voice than I’d have

408
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:35,929
thought possible.

409
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,929
“My dear Evie, always rescuing her prince
from his own lack of forethought.”

410
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:45,770
“Someone has to, Cousin,” laughs Iker,
rising to his feet while Malvina snatches

411
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:51,700
the goods from my arms. Immediately, she bustles
behind Nik, spearing the beautiful layers

412
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,540
of fondant with the fat ends of the tapers.
No thank-you from her, even though for anyone

413
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,640
else, her trained manners would require it.

414
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,510
Nik begins the song before they’re all lit.
His voice soars above us all, even over Iker’s

415
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,160
baritone. As usual, I just mouth along to
the words—my singing voice was ruined the

416
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:19,339
day I lost Anna. Tante Hansa says I’m lucky
that is all the sea took. Nik has his eyes

417
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:24,880
shut and isn’t even facing his cake, the
flames flickering and twisting behind him,

418
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,080
manipulated by a strong wind from deep within
the Øresund Strait.

419
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:37,079
My gaze follows the wind into the dark distance.
Just past the edge of our wake, the indigo

420
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,610
skies go pitch-black, the furrowed edges of
an angry line of clouds moving in at a furious

421
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,610
pace.

422
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,990
“Iker,” I breathe.

423
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:53,320
“. . . Hun skal leve højt hurra . . .” Nik
hits the final line of the traditional birthday

424
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,650
song and turns to blow out the candles, opening
his eyes just as the first of the fireworks

425
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,640
shoots off from the beach. Bursts of white
and red stream across the sky in quick succession,

426
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,319
illuminating Havnestad below and the ring
of mountains surrounding the city proper.

427
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:17,700
“Iker,” I repeat, my eyes still upon the
clouds closing in. He turns, hand still set

428
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,410
heavily about my waist, and I point to the
storm line as a tendril of lightning strikes

429
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,660
the water just beyond the confines of the
harbor.

430
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,869
A flash of recognition hits his eyes as they
read the distance between the rain and the

431
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:37,720
ship. “Storm!” he yells, a clap of thunder
cutting off the end of the word. “Everyone

432
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,490
belowdecks! Now!”

433
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:46,040
But, of course, our party turns toward the
storm rather than away, human curiosity flying

434
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,040
in the face of safety. Iker, Nik, and I rush
into motion as the first fat drops of rain

435
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,160
splatter onto the deck.

436
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,809
Nik begins directing the crowd belowdecks.
Iker is up at the wheel, working to right

437
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:04,510
the ship toward the harbor after sending its
previous driver—the coal man—down below

438
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,750
to feed the steam engine.

439
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:13,020
With the rain already sheeting, the boat tips
as I climb the stairs to the stern. I cling

440
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,309
to the rail. There is no magic I can do in
the open to stop this, which makes me grateful

441
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:23,750
to be the salt of the sea and the daughter
of a fisherman. I’m not helpless in the

442
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,750
least.

443
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:30,670
Thunder rumbles deep and rich directly overhead.
The cake’s candles and the lanterns ringing

444
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:35,390
the ship have been blown out by the blustery
wind, and I’m thankful when a flash of lightning

445
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:39,500
cracks across the sky just long enough to
show me the scene.

446
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,329
Iker—getting the boat going in the right
direction, his feet planted and muscles straining.

447
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:50,160
Nik—trudging up the stairs after barring
the door down below, his crown of lemons fed

448
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,660
to the sea by the flying wind.

449
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:58,680
The cake—tipped over and beached on its
massive side as the boat lurches starboard.

450
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,660
Another clap of thunder sounds as I reach
Iker and help him hold the wheel. Iker is

451
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,869
strong enough to steer it by himself, but
the boat’s line noticeably straightens when

452
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,880
I help him maintain control.

453
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,530
“A birthday pleasure cruise!” Iker yells
across the booming skies as I smile at him

454
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:22,319
through clenched teeth. His eyes dance even
as every tendon in his neck strains to keep

455
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:29,150
our course. “All clear skies and fancy drinks.
Isn’t that what Nik promised?”

456
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,160
Muscles already screaming, we both focus on
the lighthouse at the edge of the harbor,

457
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,849
still minutes away. A heavy wave crashes along
the deck, taking the remainder of the cake

458
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:45,190
with it. Nik manages to hold tight to the
stair railing, his white dress shirt plastered

459
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,530
against his skin.

460
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:53,090
“We’re too slow,” Iker yells into my
ear between peals of thunder.

461
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,819
I nod and grit my teeth further as a gust
of wind pulls the ship portside, yanking the

462
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:04,550
wheel with it. “I’ve got it,” I say.
“But we won’t go any faster unless—”

463
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,560
I nod toward his prized craft, a present from
his father.

464
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:16,190
Iker nods, heeding my suggestion. “Nik!”
he yells over the whipping wind and angry

465
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,720
waves. “My schooner! Help me cut it loose!”

466
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,530
Somehow Nik hears him and immediately pulls
himself portside, where Iker’s little boat

467
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,040
is adding too much weight.

468
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,740
Another wave tips up the ship, sending us
starboard. Boots sliding, I manage to keep

469
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,720
us steady, pinning the wheel in place with
all my weight. On the main deck, Nik has made

470
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,640
his way over to the portside rail. He hooks
one long arm around the rail to steady himself,

471
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,410
and then works furiously with his free hand
on my knot. Iker is on his way there.

472
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:58,310
The boat lurches again, and I close my eyes,
willing land to get closer. When my eyes open,

473
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:03,690
we might be closer to Havnestad’s docks,
but only by a few feet. I twist my head to

474
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,900
the side and see that Nik nearly has the knot
free.

475
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,700
A whitecap splashes over the side, drenching
Nik. He shakes his head, wavy hair splaying

476
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,380
out to the side. He rights himself, the slick
railing and new floorboards doing him no favors

477
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:25,220
in traction or leverage. With one final pull,
the rope is completely loose, and slides over

478
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,730
the side of the ship. Nik, much stronger than
he looks, hangs on as the steamer’s equilibrium

479
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,930
changes with the loss of Iker’s schooner.

480
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:39,869
“Three hundred yards to the royal dock!”
Iker yells, making his way to the wheel. I

481
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:45,990
look from Nik back to land. The lighthouse
is indeed finally closing in, the blaze atop

482
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,809
the tower looming just below the steely thatch
of clouds.

483
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:54,980
But not as fast as the biggest wave we’ve
seen yet.

484
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:00,720
Black as the sky above, the wall of water
splashes hard on the portside, sending Nik

485
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,650
to his knees. I call out for him to stay down—a
lower center of gravity is safer—but my

486
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,770
small voice is swallowed up in the storm.

487
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,119
He stands.

488
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,960
A charge of lightning rips across the sky.

489
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:22,490
The ship tips, pulled down with the weight
of the wave, rocking Nik headfirst into the

490
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,550
deep.

491
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,670
4
“NIK!”

492
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:35,910
I scream his name as loudly as I can. The
boat rights itself, but there’s no sign

493
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:42,299
of him along the portside. Only wet wood and
sea foam where he once was.

494
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:48,799
“NIK!” I wail again and let go of the
wheel, passing Iker and sprinting toward the

495
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,660
stairs to the main deck.

496
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,630
My mind moves faster than my wind-battered
body, a string of thoughts running together

497
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:01,020
in the murk as I dash forward, not caring
or paying attention to the wind, the rain,

498
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,590
the course, or even Iker.

499
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,940
No.

500
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,210
You CANNOT have him, you wicked sea.

501
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,609
Your mermaids will have to take someone else.

502
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:12,180
Nik belongs to me.

503
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,359
“Evie!” Iker yells. “Don’t! Come back!
It’s not—”

504
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,420
“NIK!” I lunge down the stairs. The deck
boards are slick under my boots, but I race

505
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,059
to the spot where Nik fell. The wind whips
my curls about my face as I squint through

506
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:33,579
the rain and night at the churning sea below.
“NIK!”

507
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:39,800
I yell his name over and over, my voice becoming
raw and weak, to the point where it’s barely

508
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:47,150
a whisper. Finally, we reach the royal dock.
I drop onto the wood before Iker and the coal

509
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:53,750
man even have time to anchor. I scan the horizon
for any sign of a long arm, a flop of hair,

510
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,099
or a piece of boot.

511
00:42:55,099 --> 00:43:00,240
Iker heaves himself over the railing and onto
the dock next to me, leaving the coal man

512
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,520
to free the rest of the passengers from the
captain’s quarters. “Evie,” he says,

513
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,540
his voice much calmer than it should be—the
sea captain in him overruling his bloodline.

514
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:16,460
“Look there.” He points to just this side
of the horizon, where the stars have returned,

515
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,020
unhidden by the clouds. “The storm’s almost
over. Nik’s a strong swimmer.”

516
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,330
I nod, my hopes pinned on the reason in his
eyes. “But we still need to find him,”

517
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:34,010
I say. Everything my father taught me about
the sea kicks in, and I point to a spot in

518
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,400
the churning waves. “We were about there.”
I move my outstretched fingers in a sloping

519
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,819
line in the direction of the wind, following
the line until it lands on the cove side of

520
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:49,410
Havnestad Beach. “Which means he will most
likely be . . . there.”

521
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:56,210
I don’t look to Iker for confirmation—I
just take off down the dock, tear onto the

522
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,049
sand, and race across the shoreline in that
direction.

523
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:06,730
“Nik!” I choke, my voice still raspy and
hopeless against the wind. Iker is on my heels

524
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,610
for a few strides and then ahead of me in
a few more.

525
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:17,310
Havnestad Cove is part jutting rock, part
silty beach. There’s a rolling W shape to

526
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:22,319
it, and a few large boulders form footstep
islands toward its center, before the waters

527
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,390
become too deep. In good weather, it’s a
beautiful escape from the rest of the harbor.

528
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,890
In bad weather, it’s a hurricane in a birdbath.

529
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:39,579
Iker points to the biggest island—Picnic
Rock. “I’m going there to see what I can.”

530
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:45,690
The wind is already calming, the rain tapering
off. Even the lightning seems to be behind

531
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:52,319
us, disappearing with the storm into the mountains.
The swiftness of such a powerful storm confounds

532
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,580
me. The magic in my blood prickles at the
strangeness, but I have no time to think of

533
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,880
things beyond this world.

534
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,240
I tilt my chin toward a mass of rocks farther
along the shore, the point that makes the

535
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,410
W by jutting deep into the middle of the cove.
It’s just tall enough that it blinds us

536
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,030
from the remainder of the beach.

537
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,109
“I’ll climb up there and take a look on
the other side.”

538
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:21,780
“Wait!” Iker says, his face weary. For
once, he doesn’t seem to know what to say.

539
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:27,450
He reaches his hand through my hair and pulls
me close. My heart is pounding.

540
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:34,200
“Iker, we ca—” The words are whispers
on my tongue—that we can’t delay, that

541
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,579
he shouldn’t slow me down—when he tips
my chin up and his lips are on mine.

542
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:47,060
I breathe him in, long and deep, and for a
moment we’re not on a gritty beach, soaked

543
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:54,119
to the bone, searching for Nik. We’re somewhere
far from here. A place where class, title—none

544
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:00,720
of that matters. Somewhere that surely doesn’t
exist outside of this instant. Another trick

545
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,860
of the gods.

546
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:08,079
He pulls back, and I’m stunned still, staring
into his cool eyes.

547
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,339
“Be careful,” he says.

548
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:16,300
Shaken back to reality, I pick up my waterlogged
skirts and run along the coastline to the

549
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,970
wall of stone. The swift clouds have almost
reached their end, their tail nearly directly

550
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:28,140
above the cove entrance. Starry night reigns
above the massive sea beyond, calm waters

551
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,359
with it. My eyes are constantly scanning the
waves, looking for any sign of Nik.

552
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,059
But there’s nothing.

553
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:42,970
I steal a glance back at Iker. He’s already
made it to Picnic Rock, hoisting himself up.

554
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:48,010
I breathe a sigh of relief that the stormy
churn didn’t wash him away and turn back

555
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,079
to the approaching boulder just steps ahead.

556
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,710
I’ve climbed this giant rock hundreds of
times since childhood, as have most of Havnestad’s

557
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:02,460
youth. I know the placement of the fingerholds
with my eyes shut; my boots automatically

558
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:08,520
drift to the perfect places to wedge themselves
before taking another step up. The rain has

559
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,230
all but stopped now, and the crag of stone
is mostly damp, not slick.

560
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:20,390
I lug myself on top and scan the waters again,
squinting at every irregularity, struggling

561
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,950
to use the limited moonlight to make out what
is yet another coastal rock and what might

562
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,420
be Nik. I close my eyes, dread piling at my
feet as I pivot toward the hidden portion

563
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:37,609
of the cove. When my eyes spring open, I have
to blink again to make sure my mind isn’t

564
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:44,460
playing tricks. A flash of bright-white fabric
swims on the distant sandy line.

565
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,900
My heart swells with hope. I scramble down
the rock and onto the other side of the beach.

566
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:56,530
My feet work overtime to propel my body forward
as the wet sand swallows my boots with each

567
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,530
step.

568
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:02,710
Lightning radiates over the mountains, illuminating
the sky for a flash—long enough for my brain

569
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,339
to register the outline of Nik’s body against
the sand.

570
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:11,040
And the form of a girl hovering over him.

571
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,720
“NIK!” I yell, my voice coming back to
me.

572
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,920
In response comes Iker’s baritone from behind,
“Evie!”

573
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,650
But I don’t wait for him. I don’t even
turn in Iker’s direction, keeping my eyes

574
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:32,390
only on Nik and the girl leaning over him,
her body still mostly submerged. Without another

575
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:37,910
stroke of lightning, I can’t make out much
more than her long, long hair—so long it

576
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:40,609
drapes over the white of Nik’s shirt.

577
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:44,750
The girl’s head tilts up in the moonlight
as if she’s just now noticed me running

578
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:50,859
toward her at full speed. The lightning returns
in a burst, and though my legs keep moving,

579
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:53,059
my heart skids to a stop.

580
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:59,880
Large blue eyes. Butter-blond curls. Creamy
flush of skin.

581
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,240
It’s the girl. The one from the porthole.

582
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
Anna?

583
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,170
No, it can’t be.

584
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,190
Recognition seems to fill the girl’s eyes,
and her features skip from contented calm

585
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:18,750
to a pure rush of panic. Panic that sends
her straight into motion. A gust of wind pushes

586
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:24,030
her hair over the curve of her shoulder as
she takes one hasty and last glance at Nik’s

587
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,789
face before heaving herself fully into the
water.

588
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:34,680
“Wait!” I yell as best I can, but it’s
useless with her ears deep under the waves.

589
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,680
In less than a breath, I get to Nik and crash
to the sand next to him, pulling his chest

590
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,650
to mine, my ear to his mouth. A rush of air
from his lips touches my cheek as Iker yells

591
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,940
both our names from behind.

592
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:55,770
Nik’s lungs work in great rasps, but they
work. His eyes are closed, but he seems to

593
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:56,770
be conscious.

594
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,770
“Evie . . .”

595
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,980
“I’m here, Nik. I’m here.”

596
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:07,250
A ghost of a smile touches his lips. “Evie
. . . keep singing, Evie.”

597
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:13,750
Confused, I begin correcting him. “Nik,
I’m not—I don’t . . .”

598
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:20,880
My mouth goes dry. I scan the waters for any
sign of the girl. The girl who looks like

599
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,910
Anna all grown up. The girl who must like
to sing the way my friend did as a child.

600
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:33,400
At first, there’s still nothing. Just ever-calming
waves and starry night, backlit by the summer

601
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,230
solstice moon.

602
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:41,140
But then, just at the edge of the cove, I
see it.

603
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,849
Blond hair gone silver under the clear moon,
peeking up for a swift moment before the girl

604
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:52,630
dives back underwater. A trail of sea spray
flies up in her wake—and with it comes something

605
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,819
more.

606
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:59,640
The perfect outline of a tail fin.

607
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,329
FOUR YEARS BEFORE

608
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:08,500
The sun was out, as fierce and as hot as possible
in Havnestad. It wasn’t as fierce or hot

609
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:14,329
as it is in other places, but memorable to
those in the mild-mannered Øresund Kingdoms,

610
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:19,140
much more accustomed to Mother Nature’s
cold shoulder than her steamy smile, though

611
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,180
it was the height of summer.

612
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:28,029
Two girls, one with waves of blond, one with
curls of black, pranced along the shoreline.

613
00:51:28,029 --> 00:51:32,890
Their voices lifted toward the naked June
sun, carried aloft by a deep wind from within

614
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,000
the strait.

615
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,400
A boy, already as tall as a man, trailed them,
piccolo to his lips, writing a tune for the

616
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,750
girls’ merry lyrics.

617
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:47,810
Despite the sun, the main beach was clear,
the majority of Havnestad hauling fish and

618
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:53,150
hunting whales at sea, the bustle of a modern
economy weathering a boom. They would flood

619
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:58,819
the shores with catch and tales soon enough,
returning that night for the days-long Lithasblot

620
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:04,829
festival and the midsummer full moon. For
now, the whole stretch of sand belonged to

621
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:07,549
the two girls and their boy.

622
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:13,059
The waves, heavy and exuberant, churned in
the strong wind, tossing themselves at the

623
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:18,890
girls’ ankles—bare without anyone there
to correct them. The boy’s boots were on—his

624
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:23,440
feet were gangly and hairy in a way they hadn’t
been last summer, and he didn’t want the

625
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:30,220
girls to see. He stayed on dry sand, just
beyond the waves’ reach, coal-dark eyes

626
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:35,230
pinned on the girls’ delicate toes, which
also seemed to have changed in a year, but

627
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,640
only maybe in the way he couldn’t look away
from the flash of skin beneath their skirts.

628
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,270
They went on like that until the girls suddenly
stopped—singing, prancing, everything—so

629
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:52,609
suddenly that the boy bumped into the raven-curled
girl’s back. She laughed it off, but both

630
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:57,809
girls’ eyes were locked on the sea. Watching
the whitecaps with wonder, adventure flashing

631
00:52:57,809 --> 00:52:59,680
in their eyes.

632
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,710
The one with the blond waves and ocean-blue
eyes spoke first. “She’s angry—foaming

633
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,589
at the mouth.”

634
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:11,840
“Are you calling the sea a rabid dog?”
asked the raven-haired one. “She wouldn’t

635
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,210
like that much.”

636
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,289
“I suppose not.”

637
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:20,609
A black brow pitched above eyes blue like
midnight. “Touch the sandbar and return

638
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:26,650
to shore?” She smiled, lips pinned in a
slight twist. “Dare you.”

639
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:33,359
The blond girl considered it, chewing on her
lip, reading the waves. Finally, in answer,

640
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,630
she began unlacing her dress’s bodice.

641
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,850
The boy sat on the sand behind the girls,
playing the piccolo so they’d think he was

642
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:47,020
distracted, not paying an inch of attention
to them as they stripped to their petticoats.

643
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,810
Even in surreptitious glances, their shoulders
and arms were things of beauty, smooth as

644
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:58,200
the marble statues his mother had commissioned
for the tulip garden. So beautiful they made

645
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:04,150
his cheeks hot. He knew he should not look—it
wasn’t right, not at the age they were getting

646
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:08,550
to be—but still, he watched.

647
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:14,300
The blond girl watched back, her eyes finding
him, cheeks pinking as her clothes fell to

648
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:21,020
the sand. The raven-curled girl thwacked her
on the shoulder, dark eyes big and knowing.

649
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,680
No secrets between friends, except those in
plain sight.

650
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,020
When the girls were ready, they stood, dresses
neatly folded, and pointed slim fingers toward

651
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,260
the sea.

652
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:38,170
On the count of three, they were gone.

653
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:44,519
5
I DON’T BELIEVE IN MERMAIDS. I DON’T.

654
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:49,109
THEY ARE JUST an abomination ancients like
Tante Hansa dream up to keep children from

655
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:54,210
doing especially dim-witted things. If you
touch that hot pot . . . if you eat that whole

656
00:54:54,210 --> 00:55:00,050
cake . . . if you take that candy . . . the
mermaids will steal you away. We’re superstitious,

657
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:04,809
children of the sea, but we’re not gullible.

658
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:05,910
Mermaids don’t exist.

659
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:11,250
But I know what I saw. I know who I saw.

660
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:17,940
Nik, for his part, doesn’t seem to remember
much. He thinks I rescued him. He thinks I

661
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,440
sang to him.

662
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,470
It’s been more than a day, and I still haven’t
told him that he’s lost his mind if he thinks

663
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:28,460
that’s what happened. Mostly because I don’t
have an answer to what really did. None of

664
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,099
it makes any sense.

665
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:35,559
No, I don’t believe in mermaids.

666
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:40,860
But I do have a strong belief in friendship—more
than anything in this world.

667
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,769
I believed it with Anna.

668
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:44,730
And I believe it with Nik.

669
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:50,039
Iker—I don’t know what to think of Iker,
though he’s standing right before me on

670
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,640
the royal dock, borrowed crew packing a borrowed
ship behind him.

671
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,109
“Come—the sea calls.” Iker brushes away
a few of my curls and cups his hand about

672
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:06,869
my ear as if to amplify the sea’s ancient
voice. He leans down, his cheek brushing right

673
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:13,700
against mine, his lips warm next to my skin
as he whispers, “Evelynnnnn.”

674
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,690
His enthusiasm makes my heart skip, and I
wish I could go, but Father is leaving this

675
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,779
morning as well, and he hates the idea of
me being aboard a different ship while he

676
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:28,550
is at sea too. He’s superstitious to a fault,
even if it’s just for a quick trip up the

677
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:34,760
Jutland and back before Sankt Hans Aften and
the opening of the Lithasblot festival. Iker

678
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,990
is enchanted by sightings of a large whale—one
that would feed Rigeby Bay for weeks in both

679
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:47,619
meals and trade. I hate it, but I know Iker
must go—the seafaring season waits for no

680
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:49,630
one, not even a prince.

681
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:56,400
“I’m so very sorry to disappoint,” I
say. And I am. This time with him has been

682
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,450
strangely magical, even if all we’ve done
is sit with Nik, telling stories to make him

683
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,250
smile as he recovers.

684
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:09,000
“Too late, the sea is already disappointed—your
skills during the storm were top-notch. You’re

685
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,270
a sailor she needs upon her waves.” His
eyes flash, the curve of his mouth serious.

686
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:23,049
Vulnerable, even, as strange as that is. But
I don’t—I can’t—let myself think that

687
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:28,220
it’s he who needs me and not the sea. Reality
doesn’t work that way.

688
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,789
“The sea will have to wait.”

689
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:35,360
“And so will I.” He bends down to kiss
me then, and though it’s the second time,

690
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,480
it’s still a shock—a deep dive into ice-capped
waters.

691
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:46,050
“You don’t have to go,” I say when we
part, my voice small and slurred.

692
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:51,660
“What’s that?” he says, pretending not
to have heard. “You don’t have to stay?”

693
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,510
He grabs my hand in both of his and begins
to tug me toward the ship, full of crew waiting

694
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:02,539
for his instruction. “Splendid, let’s
get going—you steer; I’ll sip portvin

695
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:03,940
and keep an eye out for the whale.”

696
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:10,819
I laugh and let him tug me a little farther
up the gangplank than I should. In my heart,

697
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:17,500
I don’t believe in Father’s superstitions.
And yet I have superstitions of my own. Nik

698
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,230
is still recovering. I can’t leave. What
if he took a turn for the worse while I was

699
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,240
gone?

700
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,530
No, I must stay.

701
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:29,180
Iker will come back. He says he will.

702
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,789
I know he will.

703
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:36,380
Something changed that night on the steamer.
More during the storm than in the huddled

704
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:42,390
moments before—we’d seen each other in
our element. The salt of the sea, the both

705
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:47,650
of us. And despite choosing to stay, it is
the very last thing I want Nik to know about.

706
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:52,829
Most especially the kissing. But it shouldn’t
be too hard to keep a secret from my best

707
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:58,690
friend—after all, I’ve been keeping my
magic from Nik his whole life.

708
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:04,109
I step down from the gangplank and onto the
dock. With a wave and a shout to his crew,

709
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:09,809
Iker is off, taking our secret leagues away
as I tuck it deep within me. I watch as he

710
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:15,060
leaves the harbor, standing there just long
enough to glimpse him turning back, my hand

711
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:21,260
ready to wave. And then I set out for one
more good-bye and my daily duties, Tante Hansa’s

712
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,119
amethyst heavy in my pocket.

713
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,810
No, I don’t believe in mermaids. But I am
willing to believe in whatever it is that

714
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:34,510
happens when I kiss the amethyst to the bow
of my father’s ship before an expedition.

715
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:39,220
What happens when I cast the spell I created
using centuries-old magical wisdom.

716
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:45,089
It’s only been a few weeks, but already
it has worked, bringing in far more catch

717
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:50,250
than by this time last year. I smile when
I see the fishermen celebrating on the docks

718
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:56,440
now. After four years of suffering through
the Tørhed, a barrenness so severe the town’s

719
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,589
fishing fleet decreased by half, these hearty
cheers are welcome sounds. I haven’t heard

720
01:00:02,589 --> 01:00:07,569
them since before Anna’s death; the grumbles
from tired fishermen coming ashore to restock

721
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:12,750
on salted meat and limes have filled our ears
instead.

722
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:18,250
After three years of the Tørhed, King Asger
knew that praying to the gods was no longer

723
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:24,880
enough. Havnestad had to find a new way to
stay afloat. The royal steamship was ordered,

724
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,520
and any man not at sea was put to work building
the boat from late summer to first frost,

725
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,160
shaping wood, and fitting sheets of metal
to the smokestack.

726
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,890
But even that ship, hammered together by the
strength of this fine town, was not enough

727
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:45,500
to keep all of Havnestad’s bellies fed.
The steamer was a one-time measure. Even the

728
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,599
crown can’t afford a new ship every year.

729
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,230
I had to do something.

730
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:56,960
So, as I’ve done since the summer of Anna’s
death, I stole into Tante Hansa’s room while

731
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,920
she was off playing her weekly turn of whist
down at Fru Agnata’s shack. Hansa’s bedroom

732
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,789
is a stifling place, with the fire lit every
night, even in the summer. Dried roses line

733
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:14,069
the walls in a ring as high as she can reach—the
hundreds of them a testament to her belief

734
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:19,400
that their scent and beauty are superior to
the tulips so popular throughout the Øresund

735
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,690
Kingdoms.

736
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,569
Beneath the line of roses, in a corner opposite
the flue, there’s a sea chest draped in

737
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:32,570
shadow and an ancient moose hide. Inside is
everything the Øldenburgs fear, all they

738
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:39,040
have banished by law: gemstones, age-stained
books, cobalt bottles sealed with pinches

739
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:45,500
of cork and wax. The very same items Tante
Hansa used on me when I resurfaced in Nik’s

740
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:52,250
arms four years ago, Anna nowhere to be found.
When I’d been in bed, nearly dead myself,

741
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:59,180
watched over by Hansa and spoon-fed elixirs
tasting of perfume and age. And aged they

742
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:05,280
certainly are, passed down in shadow generations
for centuries. Someday they will belong to

743
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,750
me, I suppose.

744
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:13,380
That day I took a purple stone—one so small
that I hoped it would escape Hansa’s notice,

745
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:18,380
but big enough to have an impact. I snagged
one of the tattered books with crumbling spines,

746
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:23,190
too, fishing it out from where it was packed
under a cake of beeswax and a marble mortar

747
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,339
and pestle.

748
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:32,050
Hours after lights out, I crept down to the
beach, but well beyond Havnestad Cove. As

749
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:37,210
the shoreline thins, becoming one with the
rocky mountain, sharp boulders jut out from

750
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:42,930
the sea. The water is deeper there and the
waves choppy, but in between the shadow of

751
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:49,710
two large rocks is a swath of sand. Overhead,
stone from the edge of Havnestad has formed

752
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:55,400
into a perfect arch, the result of Urda coaxing
the sea into this crevice for thousands of

753
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,000
years.

754
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,210
This place doesn’t have a name, as far as
I know. I’ve never seen anyone come here,

755
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:06,520
and it’s hidden from view on the beach and
by the boulders from the sea. I’ve taken

756
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:12,740
to calling it Greta’s Lagoon, after my mother.
She would have liked a place like this. Deep

757
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:17,710
in the shadows of the lagoon is a small cave
barely large enough to fit two, but it’s

758
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:23,099
plenty big to store the few tinctures and
inks Tante Hansa has entrusted to me.

759
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:28,109
I moved away the few small boulders I use
to hide the entrance and lit a candle. With

760
01:03:28,109 --> 01:03:33,869
the amethyst stone cradled in one hand, I
slid the book under the meager light. The

761
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:39,869
words were ancient and yet familiar, recalling
our great goddess, Urda, and the power she

762
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:45,670
bestows on the land and sea. As the waves
splashed against the rocks outside, I read

763
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:52,559
the scrawl over and over, swirling the spells
across my tongue. It took until nearly daylight,

764
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,980
but finally I could feel the magic tingle
in my blood.

765
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:02,760
After nearly three months of practice, I spelled
Father’s boat for the first time.

766
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:08,780
Three days after that, he came home with his
first whale in more than two years. It was

767
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,750
thin, but fat enough for all the joy that
came with it.

768
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:15,200
Now the spell is a must.

769
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,660
The need to keep Father safe and prosperous
is thick in my veins each morning when I wake,

770
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:25,329
jamming my heart with anxiety until I can
do my job. My part.

771
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:29,990
Even when I’ve done my duty and he’s away
for days, I come to the harbor and spell any

772
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:35,360
ship docked and still. The fishermen are used
to seeing me daily now. They don’t seem

773
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:40,160
to find it strange that I’m always there,
letting my closed palm trail along the salt-worn

774
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,779
bodies of ships, old and trusty.

775
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:50,080
And today is the day I begin to do more. Along
with what I cannot claim, I have been working

776
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:56,000
away on something I can. Something all of
Havnestad will recognize as helpful and not

777
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,059
some fate of Urda.

778
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:03,869
“Evie, my girl!” Father is hauling a crate
up to the deck of his whaler—Little Greta,

779
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:08,660
also named for my mother. There isn’t a
single crate of supplies left on the dock

780
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:13,769
beside the ship. I’ve only just caught him.
“I wasn’t sure you’d come.”

781
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:18,990
I laugh lightly, fingers tight over the gem
in my palm. “Just because I want you to

782
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:21,880
stay doesn’t mean I’ll miss you going.”

783
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,460
Father’s mouth settles into a tart line,
the sun spots marring his forehead crinkling

784
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:33,789
up to his black hair—he’s Italian by birth,
though he’s Danish through and through.

785
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:39,109
We walk up the gangplank together. He drops
the crate two feet from the innovation I know

786
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:44,480
will make these desolate seas that much easier
to fish—a permanent cure my magic cannot

787
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:51,539
provide. Mounted proudly to the mainmast,
half-harpoon, half-rifle, my darting gun looks

788
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:55,150
as shiny and perfect as I’d hoped.

789
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:59,210
Father hugs me close. “My Evelyn, the inventor.”

790
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:06,039
“It was nothing,” I say, though we both
know that’s not true. It took me the whole

791
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:11,120
winter to create one from an old rifle and
modified harpoon, but if my calculations are

792
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,720
correct, the contraption will send out both
a bomb lance and a tether harpoon, narrowing

793
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:22,510
the chances of a whale escaping. If all goes
well with Father’s maiden voyage, we might

794
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:26,329
be able to transform the way Havnestad snags
its whales.

795
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:30,160
“It’s not nothing. It’ll be a revolution.”

796
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:37,550
I tilt my face up to his, brow raised. “It’ll
still be a revolution if you wait a week.”

797
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:41,910
Father bristles at the sore spot between us.
He’s not the only fisherman headed out during

798
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:48,269
the festival, though far more are staying
than leaving, bolstered by their recent luck—my

799
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:55,049
recent help. But he’s the only one I care
about. And, as the royal fisherman, he’s

800
01:06:55,049 --> 01:06:58,400
the only one King Asger cares about as well.

801
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,240
“There will be other Lithasblot festivals,
Evelyn. If you’ve been pelted with bread

802
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,369
once, you’ve been pelted with bread a thousandfold.”

803
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,170
“But—”

804
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:11,319
He cuts me off with rough fingers on the point
of my chin.

805
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:17,420
“But nothing. I have to seize my luck while
it’s there.” Father’s grizzled old thumb

806
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:23,380
settles on my bottom lip. “I’ll return
for the close of the festival—the ball.”

807
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:28,950
Despite my disappointment at yet another good-bye,
I form a tight smile after his words. “If

808
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:34,839
you’ve seen me once in my only nice dress,
you’ve seen me a thousandfold.”

809
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:39,369
He leans in and gives me a quick kiss on the
cheek, his beard both soft and rough against

810
01:07:39,369 --> 01:07:40,369
my skin.

811
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:43,710
“Take care of Hansa, my dear.”

812
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:48,359
I hug him to my chest, the cloying scent of
pipe tobacco catching in my lungs.

813
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:52,319
“If only she’d allow such a thing, I would.”

814
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:58,569
He releases me with a single squeeze of my
forearm. I turn for the gangplank, one last

815
01:07:58,569 --> 01:08:04,369
look at both him and my first stab at whaling
innovation. When I’m back on the sun-ruined

816
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:09,160
wood of the dock, Father yells for his men
to hoist up the gangplank and anchor.

817
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:15,759
Before he’s gone, and with the sailors distracted
by departure duties, I take my chance and

818
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:20,790
press my little stone to the ship, right under
my mother’s name, painted in block letters

819
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:27,290
across the stern. My eyes flutter to a close,
and I whisper my spell into the breeze coming

820
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:31,250
in off the Øresund Strait.

821
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:39,660
6
IT’S A PERFECT NIGHT FOR BURNING WITCHES.

822
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:46,150
That’s what Sankt Hans Aften is, after all.
A celebration in the name of ridding people

823
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:51,890
like me from this earth through flames, drowning,
banishment—whatever seemed right at the

824
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:52,890
time.

825
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:58,430
Today, thankfully, witches are only burned
in effigy. It’s the traditional opening

826
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:04,900
of Havnestad’s version of Lithasblot. Ours
is the earliest in the Øresund Strait, but

827
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:11,390
we’re also the longest festival, five whole
days, drawing people from all around to watch

828
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:18,021
the games, sing songs in celebration of Urda,
and taste plates of tvøst og spik: black

829
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:25,350
whale meat, pink blubber, and sunny potatoes.
Even through the Tørhed, the people of Havnestad

830
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:30,550
have always been willing to sacrifice their
limited food supply to honor the goddess.

831
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:36,570
As the bonfire grows hot, shooting tendrils
of flames high into the salmon-toned sky,

832
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:42,370
the festival is ready to begin. First is King
Asger’s speech of love and gamesmanship.

833
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:46,330
Now Nik’s speech of love and gamesmanship.

834
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:53,140
For on the night of that treacherous storm,
Nik, thankfully, still came of age. And as

835
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:58,860
tradition demands, he must take the reins
of the festival—near-drowning is not an

836
01:09:58,860 --> 01:09:59,860
excuse.

837
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:04,850
Thus, since regaining most of his strength,
he’s been shut away, pacing the halls of

838
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:10,240
the palace with his father’s words on his
lips. I’ve heard him run through it twice—before

839
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:17,540
his birthday and after, and both times he
was excellent, if not a hair too fast. Still,

840
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:22,280
that’s just because this is new to him.
I know he’ll be amazing.

841
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:28,370
But Crown Prince Asger Niklas Bryniulf Øldenburg
III, first in line to the throne of the sovereign

842
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:33,470
kingdom of Havnestad, does not share my assessment.

843
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:38,980
Nik is nearly white with nerves. His long
fingers shake as he tugs his hair flat. This

844
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:44,210
day is already hard for the both of us—the
fourth anniversary of Anna’s drowning—and

845
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:50,140
with the pressure of the speech added atop
that, Nik looks as if he might keel over.

846
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:55,640
I don’t hesitate to snag a hand and press
my fingers around his. Somehow, seeing him

847
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:01,560
so nervous calms my own reservations—about
my innovation’s trial run with Father, about

848
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,910
the fact Iker has yet to arrive. I squeeze
Nik’s fingers. “You’ve done nothing

849
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:10,460
but practice for the past week. You’ll be
just fine.”

850
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,950
“But I’m not cut out for this, Evie.”

851
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:18,890
“Of course you are! You’re cut from the
Øldenburg cloth. Kings for a thousand years.”

852
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:25,590
I lean in, my face consuming his vision. “This
speech is in your blood.”

853
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:30,871
Nik turns red and averts his gaze. “I think
that particular blood spilled out of me when

854
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:33,680
I bashed my leg on that rock at ten.”

855
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:38,910
I nearly laugh, thinking of Nik passing out
at the sight of his own blood. Right in the

856
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:44,230
middle of a trail leading up Lille Bjerg Pass.
Anna and I stripped off our stockings and

857
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:48,800
tied them tightly above the gash across his
shin before bracing him between us and hobbling

858
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,980
down the mountain.

859
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,550
“Think of your birthday. You didn’t seem
at all nervous while you sang on a bench with

860
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,900
lemons in your hair.”

861
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,990
“That wasn’t the whole kingdom. This is.”

862
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,190
“So? What’s a few more faces?”

863
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:08,130
He lets out a very royal snort. “Since when
does a ‘few’ mean a hundred times more?

864
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,640
And maybe my disastrous birthday is not the
best image to calm my nerves.”

865
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,720
“Oh, don’t be dramatic.”

866
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:19,140
Nik cocks a brow. “Oh, but you’re not
plenty dramatic when you make moon eyes at

867
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,140
the harbor, scouting for a certain sailor
from Rigeby Bay?”

868
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:29,660
I say nothing, my wit tied to a stone in the
pit of my stomach. Despite myself, I squint

869
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:35,030
out at the water, my heart willing Iker’s
boat to appear. But the sea beyond the harbor

870
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:40,920
is clear, all the visiting ships and off-duty
whalers already in port.

871
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:46,260
Nik sighs, and I know he’s beating himself
up for such a quip—and again I’m thankful

872
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:52,000
he knows nothing of the kisses Iker and I
shared. He squeezes me close again, the nervous

873
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,160
tremble subdued. “He’ll be here. Iker
makes his own rules, but he never breaks his

874
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,160
word.”

875
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,710
That was the last thing he said to me before
Queen Charlotte pulled him away for his final

876
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:09,340
speech preparations. I sink to the sand and
sit, a little doll in my lap dressed in black

877
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:15,080
and white. Ready for the ashes. I can barely
force myself to play along. And without Nik

878
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:19,410
by my side, this year I play along alone.

879
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:24,790
I suppose I could join the castle workers—I’ve
known them since I was a small child. But

880
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:30,760
I’m not truly one of them. And the other
girls my age? Well, they’re never really

881
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,760
an option—they’ve made that much clear
over the years.

882
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,300
Maybe banishment wouldn’t be such a bad
thing—I could just break out my magic as

883
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:44,620
we burn our little witch dolls and leave this
place for good. But then I’d leave Nik for

884
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,790
good too. And implicate my entire family.

885
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:54,830
So, I sit alone—the secret witch, the prince’s
friend who doesn’t know her place.

886
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:59,500
I am well within eyeshot of Nik as he readies
to speak—in the event that his courage has

887
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,500
retreated up Lille Bjerg Pass—but far enough
to the side that I have a clear view of the

888
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,160
sea in my periphery.

889
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,620
He will come.

890
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,980
He said he would.

891
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,440
You shouldn’t care anyway.

892
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,440
I turn my attention back to the royal family.
And to the flames I must face before Nik’s

893
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,440
big moment.

894
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:23,020
There’s a traditional speech honoring this
“celebration” too. And though the king

895
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,060
may have ceded his duties to Nik, Queen Charlotte
would never give up her chance to speak out

896
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,830
against the horrors of witchcraft.

897
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:38,100
The queen is a beauty by any measure, all
fine bone structure and swanlike grace. Her

898
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:43,230
hair is curled and coiled atop her head, a
deep blond halo around a crown of sapphires

899
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:49,620
and diamonds. When she steps forward in the
sand, she looks every bit a painting in the

900
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,620
firelight.

901
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:55,750
In her hands is her ceremonial first doll—clothed
in blood red.

902
01:14:55,750 --> 01:15:00,290
As if the death of every Dane in the past
six hundred years was the fault of a witch.

903
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:05,230
As if the Øldenburgs hadn’t burned hundreds
of women with flimsy proof.

904
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:10,851
As if “the witch hunter king,” King Christian
IV, hadn’t been proud of the name he earned

905
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:13,990
and of the lives he ruined.

906
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:20,210
“Good evening, dear ones.” Queen Charlotte
smiles to the crowd, and it’s like ice cracking

907
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:27,310
under pressure. “On this night, we not only
celebrate the beginning of Havnestad’s Lithasblot,

908
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:32,220
but we remember the hardships endured by our
ancestors.”

909
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:36,960
In the shadows, my knuckles turn white as
I clench the doll in my lap. This part is

910
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,550
almost worse than tossing a replica of myself
into the fire.

911
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:47,600
“We live in safety and harmony in the Øresund
Kingdoms because of the courage of King Christian

912
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:54,230
IV. We live in safety and harmony because
of the laws he put in place. Witchcraft has

913
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:57,870
no place except in the depths of hell.”

914
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:02,980
The queen hoists the red doll above her head
so hard its little witch’s hat falls, the

915
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:09,060
fire sucking it into the flames. “Shall
there be any devils on our shores, know you

916
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:16,820
do not belong here nor in this world.” I
swear her eyes find me in this moment. “The

917
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:22,260
light will win, and you shall be swallowed
deep into the flames and returned to your

918
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,510
horned maker.”

919
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:30,190
The crowd erupts, and Queen Charlotte spins
on the spot, tossing the witch into the bonfire—royally

920
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:35,130
ousting us because our power is a threat to
her own.

921
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:41,880
We are to form an orderly line circling the
fire, but I can’t do that. I won’t do

922
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:47,160
that. Instead, I stand and toss my doll over
the heads of those charging forward, eager

923
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:53,100
to murder little wooden models of me. My mother.
My aunt. My father’s family.

924
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:59,590
I look for Nik then, who follows suit with
a smile on his face. Somewhere Tante Hansa

925
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:05,530
is laughing, her distinctive cackle hitting
my ear. I know it’s a ruse to protect us,

926
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:10,830
but I don’t know how she can pretend to
enjoy it so much. She even goes so far as

927
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:15,870
to have the most colorful doll, meddling with
pastes and dyes until she can ensure its little

928
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:21,650
outfit will be the brightest on the beach.
This year, hers is a stunning orange, thanks

929
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:27,940
to a customer who unknowingly added to her
fun by paying her in turmeric.

930
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:33,660
It’s ironic: the same townspeople who come
to her when they burn their skin, grateful

931
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:38,170
for her ancient medicinal treatments, turn
little wooden replicas of our ancestors to

932
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:45,330
ash each year on this date. And she just laughs
in their faces like it’s nothing. As hundreds

933
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:50,991
rush the fire, I sink back down to the sand
and wipe my hands on my skirts. It’s just

934
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:55,360
sweat, but it almost feels like blood.

935
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:00,160
When every last witch has been tossed, the
crowd retreats. Nik has stepped a measure

936
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:06,330
in front of his parents to the most prominent
spot on the sand, the bonfire at his back.

937
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:12,690
Even in the ochre light, his skin is unnaturally
pale. I make my gaze as heavy and focused

938
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:18,540
as possible, not even so much as blinking
until he catches my eye. I give him a smile

939
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,830
and a nod.

940
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:22,350
You’ll be splendid.

941
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:26,140
His lips curl up, and he clears his throat
with a deep breath.

942
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:32,460
“Good people of Havnestad, welcome to the
opening night of Lithasblot, when we honor

943
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:39,040
Urda and give thanks for her blessings and
bounty, be it from the sea or from land.”

944
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,351
The fire crackles happily behind him, the
tallest flames licking at the stars. Despite

945
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:49,310
the crush of people, only that crackle and
the lapping of the sea fills in the practiced

946
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:55,930
pause in the traditional speech. We all know
it by heart—and could join Nik in its recital,

947
01:18:55,930 --> 01:19:03,410
if it were appropriate. Most days, he’s
one of us. Just Nik. But tonight he’s our

948
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:08,050
crown prince, and our duty as subjects outweighs
our familiarity.

949
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,210
So we are quiet.

950
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:17,010
Nik glances up at his pause and meets my eye
again. I nod him forward even though his color

951
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,830
has suddenly returned.

952
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:25,930
“These next four days are a celebration.
Games, races, songs, and feasts in our goddess’s

953
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:33,820
name. Let us not forget that it is all for
her. It is fun. It is merry. But it has a

954
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:37,090
utility—a reason. Urda.”

955
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:42,810
There is an audible gasp in the crowd—Nik
has gone off script. He’s speaking from

956
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:45,090
the heart, and I couldn’t be prouder.

957
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:51,980
“Last year, we did the same as we will do
this week,” Nik goes on, his voice gathering

958
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:57,290
strength. “We pelted our thinnest with bread.
We sang to Urda. We watched as I carried the

959
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,190
heaviest rock down the beach.”

960
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:07,080
At this, he flexes a bicep and flashes a smile—all
his nerves replaced with bravado. A few chuckles

961
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:12,710
carry through the crowd, but there is only
one heavy guffaw—issued by Tante Hansa,

962
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:15,820
from her corner at the table reserved for
the ancients.

963
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:22,070
Nik rounds on her with a pronounced grin and
then pulls his brows together. His tone swings

964
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:29,570
back to serious. “Yes, I am aware my scrawny
feats of strength are quite hysterical. But

965
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:37,420
those are on display daily”—he grins again—“and
they are not why we do this year after year.

966
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:44,890
We do this for Urda. And some years she teaches
us a lesson and reminds us of her power.”

967
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:50,750
Nik pauses, the air heavy and silent. Not
even the bonfire dares to crackle.

968
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:56,100
“My father stood on this exact spot a year
ago and recited the very same speech he has

969
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:01,660
said for thirty years. Which his father before
him recited for thirty years before that.

970
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:07,000
Yet we were in the thick of the Tørhed—the
third year running. And did it improve when

971
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,750
we came together to sing songs about Urda
until our voices were rough and fingers bleeding

972
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:18,160
on our guitarens? No. Did it improve when
I defeated all you weaklings in the rock carry?

973
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,200
No.”

974
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:25,880
Only Tante Hansa is brave enough to cackle
this time. But no one turns her way. All eyes

975
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,700
are on our crown prince. Even the king and
queen are hanging on his every word.

976
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:36,870
“Let us remember that though we celebrate
her, Urda owes us not a morsel. Just like

977
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:43,090
the tide that laps our shores—her tide,
her shores—she can take as swiftly as she

978
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,310
can give.”

979
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:52,550
Nik pauses, his coal-dark eyes on the harbor
over our heads. I realize he’s referencing

980
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:58,780
Anna too. Honoring her as something Urda claimed
for her own, the sea doing the goddess’s

981
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,780
bidding.

982
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:06,101
“So, let us honor Urda this week, not just
celebrate her name, but truly honor her. She

983
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:11,830
is our queen—forgive me, Mother. The land
that gives us bounty. The sea that brings

984
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:19,430
us our supper as much as coins in our pocket.
She is more than a goddess—she is us. Havnestad.

985
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:26,810
And all the people within it. Without her,
we are nothing. No magic can trick her. No

986
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:35,870
words can ply her. No will can sway her. She
is queen, and we are simply her subjects.”

987
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:43,910
He comes to a full stop, eyes on the waves
beyond the crowd, posture firm and tall—regal.

988
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:49,940
Perhaps stunned by his originality and honesty,
it takes the whole of Havnestad a few moments

989
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:55,921
to process that he’s finished. I stand and
begin to cheer and clap. Nik’s eyes find

990
01:22:55,921 --> 01:23:00,230
me, and there’s a wink of relief that brushes
across his features before my view of him

991
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:06,060
is blocked—every last person leaping to
their feet, hoots at their lips and applause

992
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:15,260
gone wild. And somehow it feels as if he’s
leagues away.

993
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:21,570
7
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HIM AFTER THAT.

994
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:27,160
All the people want to shake his hand. Tell
him how awed they are by his thoughtfulness.

995
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:32,860
About how poised he was. How kingly he sounded.
How impressed they were and are.

996
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,600
Nik is swallowed by their affections.

997
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,720
And though I wait on the beach for him to
resurface, he doesn’t. Whisked away for

998
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:46,970
the night in a crowd of his subjects. Every
other creature eventually peters out for the

999
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:54,070
night too. A rush and then a trickle in exit
until it’s just me, a hot pile of kindling,

1000
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:59,270
and a few poor souls who have lost the battle
of alertness to free hvidtøl and a patch

1001
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,250
of soft sand.

1002
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:07,390
I stand, legs stiff in my boots, eyes toward
the harbor, breathing in the sharp, salty

1003
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:11,060
air. My throat tightens and tears threaten
my eyes.

1004
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,540
He’s going to be king, Evie.

1005
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:19,310
I want to laugh at my foolishness for thinking
I’d always have him. Of course everything

1006
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,390
is going to change.

1007
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:26,180
The moon is so bright that I can see the length
of the beach without any other aid. Too bright

1008
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:32,080
for my dark mood, but maybe a walk will do
me good. Clear my head. I should be happy

1009
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,830
for him, after all.

1010
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:39,270
I make my way down the docks first, taking
the worn planks in careful steps as ships

1011
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:43,410
large and small clank and bump at the sea’s
discretion.

1012
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:48,530
Naturally, the royal dock is the largest in
the harbor—with room for the king’s giant

1013
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:54,590
steamer, my father’s craft, and a dozen
other royal ships, boats, schooners, and skiffs.

1014
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:59,060
There’s a pole at the end that is empty,
though—the spot where the king’s steamship

1015
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,660
should be.

1016
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:05,100
I stare at the water there for a moment, wishing
for the second time tonight that his boat

1017
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:10,960
would materialize among the gentle rolling
waves. Just suddenly appear with Iker aboard,

1018
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,820
a shine in his eyes and laughter on his lips.
That he’d jump off the bow before anchoring,

1019
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:22,190
not able to hold himself back from me a moment
longer. That he’d pull me in deeply into

1020
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:24,040
his arms for another kiss.

1021
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,660
I blink and the thought has vanished.

1022
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:30,750
The pole is still untethered.

1023
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:34,480
There is not a single ship on the horizon.

1024
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:39,010
I step off the dock, my back to the waves
that took Anna, my head and heart throbbing

1025
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:44,460
with the wish that she would return, too.
That I’d have my friend back. That I wouldn’t

1026
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:49,060
feel the need to pin my hopes on boys who
I should’ve known all along would only care

1027
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:54,720
about me until they hit that invisible line
in the sand—blood—and then let me down.

1028
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,970
Though maybe, being highborn, Anna would’ve
felt the same way.

1029
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:05,010
I am too restless to run home to bed. To nod
and smile at Hansa’s drunken tale of her

1030
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:09,710
grand evening with her grand friends—as
if those friends didn’t just burn thousands

1031
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:16,760
of us. So I walk along the water to the cove
side, the moonlight guiding my steps, catching

1032
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,780
on the shimmering flecks of sand to create
a brilliant path along the shoreline.

1033
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:26,850
I don’t have a plan, and I don’t need
one. I just need a chance to wear myself out

1034
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:32,640
enough that I fall asleep unencumbered by
the sadness dragging my heart down to my ankles.

1035
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,430
I do have friends who aren’t royal. I do.

1036
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:41,600
I have the kids from school who tolerate me
for Nik’s sake, but only really when their

1037
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:48,350
prince is around. But for the most part, all
I see when I greet their faces is the disapproval

1038
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,640
reflected in their eyes.

1039
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,000
That girl—couldn’t save her mother.

1040
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,480
That girl—lived while her best friend drowned.

1041
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:02,240
That girl—thinks her father’s job gives
her keys to the castle.

1042
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,800
That girl—thinks herself more than a passing
fancy for the playboy prince.

1043
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,370
I meet the first rocks of the cove and stand
there, letting the salt air toss my curls

1044
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:18,210
about my face. The wind here always seems
so cleansing—like it sweeps away grime both

1045
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:23,390
physical and mental with one exhale from the
Øresund Strait.

1046
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:29,530
Tonight the cove is calm. The waves lap gently
about the shore, kissing both the sand and

1047
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:34,420
the rock formations with the same delicate
precision. There is no one else in sight,

1048
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:39,860
and this dress isn’t anything special—nothing
I have is special—so I yank off my boots

1049
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:44,040
and stockings and place them carefully on
a patch of beach not likely to be touched

1050
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:50,710
by the tide. The sand sticking to my toes,
I hop onto the first footstep island and leap

1051
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:53,940
from stone to stone until I make it to Picnic
Rock.

1052
01:27:53,940 --> 01:28:00,690
Though it’s damp from the recent high tide,
the slab isn’t so wet it’s uncomfortable.

1053
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:06,390
I gather my skirts, pull my knees to my chest,
and sit there with my eyes closed, letting

1054
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,750
the sea’s charge wash over me.

1055
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:16,720
Finally, my heartbeat slows, and I can feel
exhaustion creeping in. But I can’t sleep

1056
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:23,010
here. I force myself to stand on stiff legs
and grab my things. There’s barely a breeze,

1057
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:28,850
but a tingle runs up my spine. I cross my
arms over my chest, but I can’t get rid

1058
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:34,641
of the cold. I squint into the night, at the
shadow where the sea meets the rock formation

1059
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:39,200
splitting the cove, when I swear I see a flash
of white skin.

1060
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,000
“Hello?” I call, my body shivering.

1061
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,730
Only the wind answers, gently gaining strength
from well past the harbor and deep within

1062
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,730
the sea.

1063
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:55,161
I am suddenly awake, and I turn my attention
again to the rock wall. But there’s nothing

1064
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:57,480
to see but shadow and waves.

1065
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:02,380
Maybe it was the octopus who’s made the
cove his home, taunting me the same way he

1066
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:07,190
taunts Tante Hansa, who would like nothing
more than to bottle every last drop of his

1067
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:08,210
ink.

1068
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:13,010
But probably not. My eyes are playing tricks
on me again.

1069
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:15,170
Just as they must have on Nik’s birthday.

1070
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:20,651
“Perhaps you need to avoid the cove when
the moon is strong, Evelyn,” I mutter. The

1071
01:29:20,651 --> 01:29:23,680
moon can do funny things to a witch.

1072
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:32,300
I can hear it now, another strain in the chorus
of pity: That girl—seeing apparitions in

1073
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,930
the moonlight.

1074
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:38,480
FOUR YEARS BEFORE

1075
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:44,650
The boy heard the splashes, one right after
another, and stood, piccolo forgotten, eyes

1076
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:51,000
only on the sea. He held his breath, waiting
for the first one to surface. They were both

1077
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,960
strong swimmers, but the raven-curled girl
made a habit of winning.

1078
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:01,660
It was a hundred yards to the sandbar. A worthy
swim on any day, but as the boy surveyed the

1079
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:08,480
sea again, he knew this was not just any sea.
These were not just any waves.

1080
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,730
The sea was angry.

1081
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:15,900
The boy held his breath and took a step toward
the water, careful not to get too close—his

1082
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:21,070
mother had often lectured him on the damage
salt water could do to his fine leather boots.

1083
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:25,950
The blond girl surfaced first. She pulled
in a deep breath and then went back under,

1084
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:30,880
the sandbar in her sights, still seventy-five
yards away.

1085
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:36,320
The boy scanned the water for dark hair. Took
a breath. Squinted right at the spot where

1086
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,250
she should’ve surfaced. Still nothing.

1087
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:45,110
The blonde bobbed up again. Now ten yards
closer to the sandbar and not looking back.

1088
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:48,300
No dark hair to be seen.

1089
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:54,530
He took another step forward. A wave took
full advantage and marked his foot. On reflex,

1090
01:30:54,530 --> 01:31:02,080
he glanced down. Yes, the leather was completely
soaked. But he didn’t care. Eyes immediately

1091
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:07,340
back on the sea. Heart pounding. The wet boot
already coming off.

1092
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:14,460
There. In the distance, thirty yards out.
Not the crown of a raven-haired head.

1093
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:18,490
A single hand, reaching for air.

1094
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:24,051
The boy dove in, full breath cinched in his
lungs, and opened his eyes. Nothing but the

1095
01:31:24,051 --> 01:31:27,340
murky deep and the sting of salt.

1096
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:32,480
Thinking of the girls, of the hand, he surfaced
early. He would keep his stroke above the

1097
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,820
waves, his head close to the surface. He was
a strong swimmer, and his new height had not

1098
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:42,920
diminished his natural strength, but the undertow
was fiercer than he’d ever felt, constantly

1099
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:48,280
tugging at his pant legs. A force from the
deep pulling him toward the harem of mermaids

1100
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:53,000
all Havnestad children were told lived at
the bottom of the sea.

1101
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:59,630
At the surface, he saw nothing. Not a strand
of hair, nor a flash of hand. But he knew

1102
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:03,360
where they were. He knew where he must go.

1103
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:08,260
Twenty more yards and he opened his eyes to
the sea again. Looked down. Where the undertow

1104
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,200
had pulled him.

1105
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:15,990
Black hair curled up like a cloud of ink,
pale fingers stretched toward him. Her face

1106
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:20,920
hidden. He dove, hoping it wasn’t too late.

1107
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:26,630
Lungs burning for air, he surfaced, one arm
hooked under her shoulders. The force of the

1108
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:31,590
swim had pushed the curls from her face. Her
features bordered on blue, and he couldn’t

1109
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,330
tell if she was breathing.

1110
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:35,490
All he knew was that he had her.

1111
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:41,590
“Come on, Evie. Come on.” He prayed to
the old gods as well as the Lutheran one when

1112
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:47,340
he had the breath, his body fighting the tow
for them both, the shoreline distant but in

1113
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,340
his sights.

1114
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:53,520
Moving forward, he turned his head as much
as the weight and struggle would allow, hoping

1115
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,610
for a flash of blond safely at the sandbar.

1116
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:58,580
He saw nothing.

1117
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:04,060
On the shore, he called as loud as he could
for help. He set Evie on the sand, brushing

1118
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:07,190
back her curls, ear to her mouth.

1119
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:09,610
No breath.

1120
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:14,650
He rolled her over and pounded on her back.
Salt water streamed from her lips and nose,

1121
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,880
dribbling onto the beach.

1122
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:23,000
People came then. Men from the docks, women
from the sea lane. They crowded around, speaking

1123
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,010
in whispered tones about the girl. They never
had nice things to say about her, even with

1124
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:29,690
her this way.

1125
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:34,670
The boy told the men that there was one more.
Pointed them toward the sandbar and empty

1126
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:41,210
waves. Barked orders of rescue. The men listened.
Because of the boy’s name.

1127
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:45,560
The boy blew air into the girl’s lungs and
pounded her on the back again, moving her

1128
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:51,810
hair out of the way to make more impact. More
water came forth, this time in a great gush,

1129
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,360
along with the rasp of a breath.

1130
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,490
Her eyes blinked open, dark and worn.

1131
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:59,660
“Nik?”

1132
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:03,170
“Yes! Evie, yes!”

1133
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:08,860
Smiling briefly, he hugged her close then,
even if it was inappropriate, with her bare-shouldered

1134
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:15,150
in her petticoat and him a prince. But he
didn’t care because she was alive. Evie

1135
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,800
was alive.

1136
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,380
“Anna?” she asked.

1137
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,750
They turned their eyes to the sea.

1138
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:31,980
8
HAVNESTAD THRUMS WITH ENERGY.

1139
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:35,890
The brightness of summer and the thrill of
Urda’s festival combine to create the kind

1140
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:41,880
of charge one usually witnesses with a coming
storm. It has me up early, feeling light and

1141
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,710
free after such a black night.

1142
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:50,640
As I walk down to the harbor, amethyst in
my pocket, I see Nik’s carriage pass by.

1143
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:55,640
I wave my hand, but I can’t tell if he’s
seen me. He’s surely headed into the valley

1144
01:34:55,640 --> 01:35:01,690
to visit the farmers in his father’s stead,
a Lithasblot tradition. We give thanks to

1145
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:04,410
Urda but also to those who work our fields.

1146
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:10,020
The ships in port are empty, but I run my
closed palm along their lengths, spelling

1147
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:15,310
them though they won’t be headed anywhere
this day or the next. On a morning as glorious

1148
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:20,980
as this one, it is not hard to conjure the
words for Urda, yet I can’t help but think

1149
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:28,560
back to Nik’s speech. No magic can trick
her. No words can ply her. No will can sway

1150
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:36,110
her. Is my spell a trick? A panic suddenly
seizes me. My heart beats fast and my feet

1151
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:43,980
feel like lead. The dock begins to spin before
my eyes. Is this my punishment? I close my

1152
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:50,280
eyes to right my balance. I’m being silly.
My magic is not meant to deceive. My words

1153
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:57,051
are intended to honor Urda, honor her sea.
Bring life. Surely she knows that. My heart

1154
01:35:57,051 --> 01:36:01,860
rate starts to slow and I leave the docks.
I need a distraction.

1155
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:07,450
Nik isn’t supposed to return from the farms
until midafternoon, and while the streets

1156
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:12,170
will soon be alive with festival visitors,
the real party doesn’t get started until

1157
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:18,120
suppertime, when Nik will have to judge the
livestock. So I walk down Market Street and

1158
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:24,310
gather a late breakfast, paid for on Father’s
account—fat strawberries, a stinky half-wedge

1159
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:30,530
of samsø, a jar of pickled herring we call
slid, and a crusty loaf of rye bread so dense

1160
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:35,220
it could pass as a sea stone—and return
to the Havnestad Cove.

1161
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:40,960
It’s quiet here, just a few couples trailing
along the rocks, none taking any notice of

1162
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:46,530
me. I remove my shoes and stockings and place
them in the same spot as yesterday, and I

1163
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:51,090
hop between the smaller footstep islands to
the big one, Picnic Rock earning its name

1164
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:57,230
yet again. The strong sun and calm tide has
made the rock almost completely dry, so I

1165
01:36:57,230 --> 01:37:01,250
lie on my back, face to the sky, and shut
my eyes.

1166
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:09,260
Though I don’t want it to, my mind shifts
to Iker. He still hasn’t returned. I am

1167
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:14,730
already anxious, and the same panicky feeling
quickly returns.

1168
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:16,560
What if something’s gone wrong?

1169
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,380
What if the steam stack exploded?

1170
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,930
What if the whale crashed into the ship’s
hull upon capture?

1171
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:23,730
Am I at fault?

1172
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:31,660
I know I’m being ridiculous, but worst of
all, we would never know. All of us are here,

1173
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:36,210
for once our eyes inward instead of turned
to the sea.

1174
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:41,090
That sends my mind into a downward spiral
about Father, and then suddenly a shadow falls

1175
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:46,190
across the backs of my eyelids, the direct
sun blotted out by a passing cloud. It’s

1176
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,220
as if the weather worries too—

1177
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:51,170
“Excuse me, miss?”

1178
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:53,140
That voice.

1179
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:59,000
My eyes pop open, searching for the face of
a friend who I know in my heart is long gone.

1180
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,030
But there, leaning over me, is the girl.

1181
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:06,780
The girl from the porthole.

1182
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,570
The one who rescued Nik.

1183
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:14,760
Yet that can’t be right, either. I really
am losing my senses today.

1184
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,080
I sit up and rapidly blink my eyes in the
sun, but when they refocus, the same girl

1185
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:25,290
remains. She shifts back, long blond hair
swinging.

1186
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:32,170
Her face is like the singsong of her voice—so
much like Anna’s, but more mature. The smattering

1187
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:37,320
of freckles around her nose is familiar too.
She wears a gown that’s nicer than all of

1188
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,630
mine put together, and her shoes shine with
new leather.

1189
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:50,920
Shoes. Feet. No fin—she can’t be what
I saw. My stomach sinks, but I don’t know

1190
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:51,920
why.

1191
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,190
“This is quite embarrassing, but . . .” The
girl’s eyes fall to the strawberry in my

1192
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:59,260
hand. “I haven’t eaten in more than a
day.”

1193
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:06,330
I’m so stunned, I just hand over the strawberry.
She isn’t ready for it and bobbles it in

1194
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:11,600
her fingertips before taking a bite. I shove
my whole meal toward her.

1195
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,640
Anna loved cheese and fruit.

1196
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,820
“Oh, no, you don’t have to, I—”

1197
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:21,760
“I insist,” I say, and I’m surprised
that’s what comes out because there are

1198
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:27,720
so many other words on my tongue. So many
questions. But I’m almost terrified to ask

1199
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:32,740
them because I know what word will fall out—Anna.

1200
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:36,540
The girl eats, and I try to figure out what
to say next.

1201
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:38,840
Did you save Nik?

1202
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,590
Were you a mermaid?

1203
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:41,950
Are you Anna?

1204
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,620
Don’t you remember me?

1205
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:51,210
All would make me run if I were her. So, as
she chews a hunk of rye bread, I open the

1206
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,350
jar of slid.

1207
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:55,290
“Do you feel better?” I ask.

1208
01:39:55,290 --> 01:40:01,010
“Yes, much. Thank you. I’m so sorry. I’m
done.”

1209
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:07,400
I shake my head and tilt the open jar toward
her, the little herring bobbing in their brine.

1210
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,120
“Eat, please.”

1211
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:15,040
She sees the fish and recoils, waving her
hands in front of her face. I pull out a herring

1212
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:20,920
and eat it myself, yanking the bones out by
the tail before discarding them into the cove.

1213
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,500
She looks at me as if I’ve just bitten off
her ear.

1214
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:31,560
I used to do the same thing to Anna. She didn’t
like slid either. I smile, but on the inside,

1215
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:37,050
the sadness is suffocating. I have to stop
looking for the dead in the living.

1216
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:40,530
“Are you sure you aren’t still hungry?”
I try. “There’s more cheese.”

1217
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:48,590
“No. I’ll be fine.” A sob swallows the
word fine. Her brow furrows and the skin under

1218
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:55,280
her lashes reddens; there are no tears, but
she looks exactly like she should be weeping.

1219
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:00,490
My hand flies to her shoulder to comfort her.
When the girl catches her breath, she begins

1220
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:06,270
talking again, her voice almost a whisper.
She doesn’t seem to mind me touching her.

1221
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:09,750
“I ran away from home.”

1222
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:11,900
“Oh, Anna—”

1223
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:16,330
The girl’s eyes fly to mine. “Annemette.
How’d you—”

1224
01:41:16,330 --> 01:41:22,040
“I didn’t . . . I just . . . you remind
me of someone I used to know.”

1225
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:26,700
She coughs out a sob-laugh. “I wish I were
that girl.”

1226
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:32,710
“No you don’t,” I say quickly as this
girl—Annemette—wipes her nose.

1227
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:39,110
“Was her father a liar? Weaving tales about
where he’s been and what he’s done, selling

1228
01:41:39,110 --> 01:41:42,750
off all our livestock and not bringing a coin
home?”

1229
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:45,570
I shake my head because I don’t know what
to say.

1230
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:51,550
“I’ve had to sell half our fine things
to pay his debt and put food on the table.

1231
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:58,030
I couldn’t take it anymore. I took off running
over Lille Bjerg a day ago.”

1232
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:06,150
Her words are off. They seem forced. I can’t
help it—I stare at her face. I’ve seen

1233
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:12,611
thousands of faces since Anna failed to surface,
but I’ve never seen one so similar. Never

1234
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:17,910
heard a voice with the same timbre. If I hadn’t
touched her, if this girl weren’t clearly

1235
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:22,840
made of flesh and bone, I’d think she was
a ghost.

1236
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:28,360
She scrubs her face with her hands, nails
clean and shaped. Her eyes blink open and

1237
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:35,340
then she takes my hands. “I’m terrible.
Here I am, barging in on your breakfast, stealing

1238
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:41,950
your food, dumping my problems in your lap,
and yet I haven’t even asked your name.”

1239
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:44,730
“It’s Evie,” I reply.

1240
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:49,700
“Evie,” she repeats, testing my name out
on her tongue. “British?”

1241
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:55,590
“Evelyn, yes. My mother fell in love with
the name in Brighton.”

1242
01:42:55,590 --> 01:43:03,060
“I can see why.” Annemette smiles, her
teeth clean and straight, like that of a princess

1243
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,320
or a dairymaid.

1244
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:10,020
I tell myself again that she’s not Anna.
She’s not even the girl from the porthole

1245
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:16,870
or the beach or anywhere else. She’s a farm
girl from the other side of the pass. My cheeks

1246
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:23,850
grow hot. Annemette squeezes my hands. “Thank
you for your generosity, Evie—it’s a gift.

1247
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:31,830
Truly.” Her eyes sting red again and her
lip trembles. “I doubt I’ll be so lucky

1248
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:32,830
again.”

1249
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:39,490
I don’t know what to do with this openness.
This odd feeling blooming in my stomach. “You

1250
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:42,930
really have nothing and nowhere to go?”

1251
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:48,290
Annemette waves her hands across her body.
“Only my clothes and my pride.”

1252
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:55,130
I can’t explain this girl or my feelings
or why I have the need to believe her, but

1253
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:59,290
I do. And I want to help. “Come with me.”

1254
01:43:59,290 --> 01:44:08,760
9
THE LITTLE HOUSE THAT MY FATHER BUILT ISN’T

1255
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:14,660
THAT far from Havnestad Cove—it’s practically
waterside itself, the cottage at the end of

1256
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:19,900
a lane in the shadow of Øldenburg Castle.
It backs up to a thatch of trees that buffer

1257
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,820
it from a rocky cliff jutting out into the
sea.

1258
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:26,030
“It’s so quaint,” Annemette says.

1259
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:32,340
“It’s home,” I answer, and push through
the front door. It’s been a long time since

1260
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:37,450
I’ve introduced someone to our tiny cottage.
When I was little, we’d often take in children

1261
01:44:37,450 --> 01:44:42,820
while their parents were away at sea. But
that stopped after Mother died.

1262
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:48,280
At the hearth, Tante Hansa is stirring something—by
the smell of it, most likely the ham-and-pea

1263
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,880
concoction she brings to every Lithasblot
to place beside the roast hog we have on the

1264
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,841
second day of the festival. Because “there
can never be enough swine in this sodden fish

1265
01:44:57,841 --> 01:45:04,630
market.” Hansa’s back is turned, and I
feel the need to announce that we have company—it’s

1266
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:07,070
never safe for a witch to have no warning.

1267
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:11,350
“Tante Hansa, I’d like you to meet my
new friend.”

1268
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:16,340
Hansa wipes her hands, and I know by the set
of her shoulders she was stirring the soup

1269
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:22,230
without a spoon. Domestic spells aren’t
spectacular, but they’re her favorites because

1270
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:27,330
she’d never planned on having a family of
her own—and Father and I are more work than

1271
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:28,970
she’d like to admit.

1272
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:34,190
When she turns, her face is pulled up in a
smile, clear blue eyes flashing with the delight

1273
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:40,800
of catching me at something remotely unusual.
Hansa is my mother’s older sister by almost

1274
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,220
two decades, the time between them filled
with brothers who lost their lives to the

1275
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:51,370
sea’s moods much too young. She is as old
as the grief of burying all her siblings suggests.

1276
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:55,380
But I have never been able to put anything
past her.

1277
01:45:55,380 --> 01:46:02,020
Which means her reaction to Annemette is the
same as mine. Only she actually says what

1278
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:03,560
she’s thinking.

1279
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:07,600
“Why, Anna, returned from the deep, have
we?”

1280
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:13,380
Annemette’s mouth drops open as if she’s
lost her tongue, her jovial attitude gone

1281
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:14,380
as well.

1282
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:20,880
“Annemette, Tante,” I correct. “She’s
from the valley. A farm.”

1283
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,690
Hansa takes a step forward and raises a brow—quite
the feat given the blood-drawing tightness

1284
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:27,030
of her hairdo.

1285
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:34,870
“Is that so?” Hansa looks her up and down.
“Those hands haven’t seen a day of hard

1286
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:40,940
work in all your years. That fair face hasn’t
seen the sun. And that dress is worth more

1287
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:46,690
than the best cow in the valley.” She takes
a step forward and grabs Annemette’s smooth

1288
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,740
hand. “Who are you really?”

1289
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:53,640
“Tante, please, leave her be, she’s had
a rough trip—”

1290
01:46:53,640 --> 01:47:00,120
“Hush. You only see what you want to see.”
She turns back to Annemette, staring at the

1291
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:07,420
girl as if she could bend her will as easily
as she tamed the soup. “So, again I ask—who

1292
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:09,730
are you really?”

1293
01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:15,660
Annemette’s eyes have gone red around the
rims again, but she doesn’t cry. If anything,

1294
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:20,770
there’s an edge of defiance in the cut of
them. Like she’s accepted Hansa’s dare

1295
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:26,650
for what it is. But when she speaks, she says
the last thing I’d expect.

1296
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:28,800
“Your soup is boiling.”

1297
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:35,121
But the soup is more than boiling. The pea-green
liquid hisses as it rolls in violent, unnatural

1298
01:47:35,121 --> 01:47:38,360
waves over the iron pot’s rim.

1299
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:42,670
“Ah!” Hansa cackles. “I’ve seen your
type before.”

1300
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:49,500
I’m stunned. Her type? Is Annemette a witch?

1301
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,440
I stare at her.

1302
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:55,520
Another witch. My age. Next to me.

1303
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:03,480
Of all the things I can’t believe about
Annemette, this might be the most unfathomable.

1304
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:08,750
Something cracks open in my chest as the secret
we’ve held so tightly as a family flies

1305
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:17,430
into the soupy air. I stare at this face so
familiar and yet so strange, and my mind whirls.

1306
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:22,260
Anna was not a witch, but Annemette certainly
is.

1307
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:26,890
Annemette nods, and the liquid returns to
a gentle simmer.

1308
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:31,610
My aunt’s spotted hands grasp Annemette’s
again, but this time there’s a funny light

1309
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:39,470
in her eyes, all her skepticism gone. “Evie,
child, you’ve made quite an interesting

1310
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:41,610
friend indeed.”

1311
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:48,960
It’s a long while before Tante Hansa allows
us to escape, having thoroughly quizzed Annemette

1312
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:54,740
on her family. In the funny way of things,
we both claim lineage to the town of Ribe

1313
01:48:54,740 --> 01:49:00,730
and Denmark’s most famous witch, Maren Spliid.
Tied to a ladder and thrown into a fire by

1314
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:08,870
King Christian IV 220 years ago, she became
as much a lesson as a legend. Her talent was

1315
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:14,990
inspiring, but ultimately her audacity was
her undoing. Her death and so many others

1316
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:20,320
under the witch-hunter king scattered Denmark’s
witches like ashes in the wind. And our kind

1317
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:27,320
never recovered—our covens fractured, magic
kept to families and never shared.

1318
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,330
Given the time and distance, it shouldn’t
be a surprise that there’s more than one

1319
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:37,390
magical family in Havnestad related to Ribe
and Maren, yet I still can’t believe it.

1320
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:40,190
We’ve been alone for so long.

1321
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:46,100
After Hansa is finally satisfied with her
family tree, Annemette and I head outside.

1322
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:51,040
We walk into the woods behind the cottage,
where we’re shaded from every angle, including

1323
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:56,210
from Øldenburg Castle and its sweeping views,
and start to pick our way down toward the

1324
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:57,510
sea.

1325
01:49:57,510 --> 01:50:02,440
The ground is covered in gnarled roots and
branches, a danger for anyone not looking

1326
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:07,400
where they’re going. But I know this steep
path better than anyone, and I use this moment

1327
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:13,960
to steal another glance at Annemette. Her
family may be from elsewhere, but her face

1328
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,420
still belongs here.

1329
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:22,070
Anna did not have any magic in her blood,
at least as far as I know. She had two “common”

1330
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:27,780
parents and a grandmother who loved her more
than the sun. Her parents left shortly after

1331
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:33,710
Anna’s funeral. Took their titles and moved
to the Jutland—miles and miles from this

1332
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:39,530
place and the daughter they lost. Her grandmother
is still here, but she’s gone senile with

1333
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:45,150
grief, the loss of her family too much for
her mind. I see her at the bakeshop sometimes,

1334
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:49,720
and she calls every person there Anna. Even
me.

1335
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:56,230
“What?” Annemette says, catching me looking
as we pass between twin trees, slick with

1336
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:57,670
sap.

1337
01:50:57,670 --> 01:51:03,540
I can’t tell her what I’m thinking, but
I do have questions for her. “It’s just

1338
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:08,310
. . . how did you know we were witches? If
you’d been wrong, we could’ve reported

1339
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:11,300
you. You could’ve been banished.”

1340
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:16,230
She dips her head to avoid a branch. “I
could just feel it.”

1341
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:17,910
Like Tante Hansa did.

1342
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:24,310
“I must not be much of a witch,” I say.
“I couldn’t tell. I mean, now my blood

1343
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:30,090
won’t stop singing, but an hour ago? No.”
There’s so much I don’t know about the

1344
01:51:30,090 --> 01:51:31,280
magic in my bones.

1345
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:34,920
“I’m sure you’re a fine witch, Evie.”

1346
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:41,110
It’s a nice thing to say, I suppose, but
not necessarily true. Tante Hansa teaches

1347
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:46,460
me only the most mundane of spells. But I
read her books and Mother’s books, and I

1348
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:52,440
know there is so much more. With a few words
and her will, Annemette brought out all that

1349
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,240
possibility into the open.

1350
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:58,300
“How did you do that? The soup, I mean.”

1351
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:03,150
Annemette just shrugs and hooks a hand on
a tree, swinging around it like a maypole

1352
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:08,650
ribbon. “It was just an animation spell,”
she says as if impressing Tante Hansa was

1353
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:11,040
nothing.

1354
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:15,320
The ease, the comfort, the understanding she
has about her magic makes my blood tingle

1355
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:21,570
with envy. It’s so much of what I want.
It took me months of studying and toying to

1356
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:27,610
create the spell to combat the Tørhed and
even then, I’m not sure it actually works.

1357
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:33,860
My evidence is only anecdotal, and Fru Seraphine
has taught me better than to use anecdotes

1358
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:36,420
as true measures of success.

1359
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:42,090
In a few more steps we reach the sliver of
rocky beach blind to Havnestad Cove, my own

1360
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:48,430
shortcut to Greta’s Lagoon. I try to calm
my heart from beating so loudly, but I’ve

1361
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:55,350
never gone to the lagoon in daylight and I’m
nervous. I steal a glance up the beach. It’s

1362
01:52:55,350 --> 01:53:00,230
deserted as far as I can see, everyone off
preparing for tonight’s festivities.

1363
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:06,090
“Careful,” I say as we reach the end of
the beach and the two large rocks. “The

1364
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:07,750
water is deep here.”

1365
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:14,320
I take off my stockings and shoes and wade
in. As I reach the sand, I turn around, but

1366
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:20,300
she’s still standing by the rocks. “Here,”
I say, wading back out and extending my arm.

1367
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:23,550
“Take my hand. I’ll help you.”

1368
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:30,800
With tentative steps, she walks forward and
grasps my hand tight. I smile at her. “Come

1369
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,070
on. It’s okay.”

1370
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:37,780
Once we’re in the right spot, I push aside
the small boulders that obscure the entrance

1371
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:45,020
and steer her inside. Although it’s daylight,
the cave is still steeped in shadows. I light

1372
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:50,880
a candle. Various mundane tools hang from
juts on the wall, and on the floor, oysters

1373
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:57,200
sweat in a bucket—my latest failure. On
a ledge in the rock wall are my tinctures,

1374
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:02,780
bottles full of octopus and squid ink, jellyfish
poison, and powdered crab shells.

1375
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:05,520
“You’ve made a lair.”

1376
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,330
I laugh. “‘Secret workshop’ might be
a more accurate term.”

1377
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:17,440
“Oh no, this is a lair.” Annemette’s
hands move automatically to the ledge. She

1378
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:22,100
holds each bottle up to the light, admiring
the slosh or swoosh of the contents.

1379
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:27,660
Her boot nudges the oyster bucket. “And
what are your plans for these little fellas?”

1380
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:33,020
She scoops one up and holds it in her hand
as if it’s a baby bird and not an endless

1381
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:35,020
source of frustration for me.

1382
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:40,450
“They’re barren, but I’d hoped to spell
them into producing pearls to be crushed for—”

1383
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:46,161
Annemette stops me cold with a wave of her
hand. She mumbles something I don’t understand

1384
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:51,610
under her breath, her eyes intent on the oyster
in her palms.

1385
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:59,630
Within moments, the oyster swells to a pink
as vibrant as the sunset and springs open.

1386
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:05,090
Inside is the most gorgeous pearl, perfectly
round with an opalescent shimmer.

1387
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:13,410
“It’s beautiful,” I say, though the
word doesn’t do it justice. It’s otherworldly,

1388
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:20,260
unnatural. I want to touch it, but I’m frightened
of it all the same. It seems . . . alive.

1389
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:27,820
Annemette’s grin grows mischievous. “Too
beautiful to crush, I think.” With a simple

1390
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:34,280
Old Norse command—“Fljóta”—she sets
the pearl afloat over her palm. Then, without

1391
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:40,280
saying a word, she commands a few lengths
of thread—repurposed and therefore unspooled—from

1392
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:46,310
the nails on the wall. Next, she covers the
thread and pearl with both hands, shielding

1393
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:52,760
from me the magic she’s clearly working
with her mind, her eyes set on her work. Seconds

1394
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:57,050
later, her hands part to reveal a perfect
pearl necklace.

1395
01:55:57,050 --> 01:56:00,560
“Turn around and pull up your hair,” she
says.

1396
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:05,870
I do as she says and she draws the thread
around my neck, draping it so that the pearl

1397
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:11,950
lies at the base of my throat. I don’t own
any real jewelry and have never even tried

1398
01:56:11,950 --> 01:56:17,300
any on, save for my mother’s wedding band—Father
keeps it tucked away in a little chest, along

1399
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:20,720
with letters and drawings and other tokens
from their life together.

1400
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:25,950
I touch the pearl and look up at her, but
she is busy working on another oyster and

1401
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:32,560
more string. After a few moments, Annemette
ties her own pearl necklace around her throat.

1402
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,280
“And now we match,” she says.

1403
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:41,630
My throat catches. I remember Anna saying
those words to me that time we made necklaces

1404
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:48,760
from wooden beads the tailor was giving away.
They were crude and childlike, yet still special.

1405
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:52,840
We promised to never take them off, but I
couldn’t bear to look at mine once Anna

1406
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:57,340
was gone. It’s now in a small box underneath
my bed.

1407
01:56:57,340 --> 01:57:04,401
I force a smile at Annemette. My pearl sits
in cool repose against my neck, pulsing with

1408
01:57:04,401 --> 01:57:10,340
vigor. It’s a curious feeling that is not
altogether pleasant, and I wonder if the pearl

1409
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:15,790
will always beat like this. Oddly, I find
myself hoping that it will.

1410
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:20,200
“Can you teach me?” I ask, the words spilling
from my lips.

1411
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:24,950
“What is there to teach? You’re a witch,
aren’t you?”

1412
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:29,360
“I . . . Tante Hansa hasn’t taught me
anything like that. Everything I know is like

1413
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:35,210
a recipe to make cheese—fail one segment
and the whole thing falls to curd.”

1414
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:43,130
Annemette scrunches her nose. “It shouldn’t
be that hard.” She picks up an oyster. “Here.

1415
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:44,810
Try. Fljóta.”

1416
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:51,240
Annemette sees the reluctance cross my face
and tilts her head. “It’s just a command.

1417
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:55,760
Say it with confidence and you’ll have the
magic do the work.”

1418
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:02,190
With hesitant fingers, I take the oyster in
my hand. It’s as gray and barren as ever,

1419
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:07,100
and stinky, too, a tinge of rot to it. “Fljóta.”

1420
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:12,800
The oyster shakes in my fingers but doesn’t
lift. I can’t seem to make that connection

1421
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,590
like I do when I spell Father’s ship. There’s
something missing.

1422
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:20,420
“You control the magic, Evie. It’s yours.
Take it.”

1423
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:25,730
There’s a note in her voice that’s like
a jolt—like pushing me off the dock and

1424
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:27,690
into the water.

1425
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:34,150
I square my shoulders and stare at the frustrating,
rotting little thing. I feel my mother’s

1426
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:41,640
blood deep inside me. The blood of Maren Spliid.
The blood of the stregha hiding within my

1427
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:48,300
father’s “common” façade. I feel the
spirit of Urda, outside, inside, all around

1428
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:54,620
me, creating the natural energy we draw from.
I spin these feelings with all the want inside

1429
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:59,990
me—the want to have the sort of power that
could’ve saved Anna and my mother. The kind

1430
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:05,820
that can truly end the Tørhed for good, not
just mask it with a daily spell. The kind

1431
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:08,700
that Annemette seems to have.

1432
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:15,760
“Fljóta,” I say with all that want. With
the wound that lives deep in my belly from

1433
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:21,420
the day I lost Anna. The day I almost lost
Nik too. When I wanted more than anything

1434
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,280
to use my magic to make it better.

1435
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:25,940
The oyster hovers.

1436
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:32,620
“Líf,” Annemette whispers. Life. I should
give it life.

1437
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:39,490
“Líf,” I command. The oyster begins to
change colors, its gray shell warming to pink

1438
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:42,810
and then to the burnt orange of dawn.

1439
01:59:42,810 --> 01:59:48,210
The oyster grows hot. Hot enough to match
its new lively color. Its warmth licks at

1440
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:50,120
my palm.

1441
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:56,750
In a moment, the oyster pops open, the most
perfect pearl at its center.

1442
01:59:56,750 --> 02:00:01,420
It’s beautiful. Again, it’s almost too
beautiful to crush for the magical poultice

1443
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:06,250
I’d planned, but there’s so much magic
I now want to make with it.

1444
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:11,470
Annemette laughs. “And that, my friend,
is how you command the magic.”

1445
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:17,570
Although the spell is over, I can still feel
the magic pulsing through my veins, a blue

1446
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:23,670
fire so hot, it’s cold. It’s unlike anything
I’ve ever felt before. I don’t want it

1447
02:00:23,670 --> 02:00:29,120
to stop, but I know there’s a danger in
sipping from this feeling too long.

1448
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:34,150
I set the oyster on the table I use for my
inventions, fashioned from a piece of driftwood

1449
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:39,710
I found on the beach. It’s littered with
more bottles and vials, but I clear some space

1450
02:00:39,710 --> 02:00:45,320
and hold the pearl in my fingers. Unlike the
pearl Annemette made, this one is still warm

1451
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:52,070
to the touch, not icy hot. The magic responds
differently to the two of us, I suppose—I

1452
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:54,730
don’t know. But I want to learn.

1453
02:00:54,730 --> 02:01:01,390
It’s time I really embrace who I am. Tante
Hansa has kept me in the dark for too long.

1454
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:04,400
My mother was an established healer by my
age.

1455
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:09,300
“Annemette, will you stay and teach me?”
I ask.

1456
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:15,170
“I can’t,” she replies quickly, her
mouth drawn tight, but trembling. She turns

1457
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:20,440
and braces her arms against the cave’s opening,
watching the tide come in and out.

1458
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:27,500
But I don’t understand. Why is Annemette
so upset? Why must she suddenly leave?

1459
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:32,850
“You can stay,” I insist. “You’re
safe here from your father, and we have more

1460
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:38,350
than enough room. And you’ll be with us.
With a family that cares for you and understands

1461
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:42,520
you. You don’t have to run away to find
that. To be yourself.”

1462
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:48,760
Annemette meets my eyes with a look I know,
and with every force of a Viking spell, she

1463
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,670
says it again.

1464
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:52,440
“I can’t.”

1465
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:57,720
She bends down and runs her hands through
the sand, letting it fall between her fingers.

1466
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:00,290
“I can’t stay here.”

1467
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:06,441
It’s her. I can’t deny it now. She’s
not trying to deny it either. The look she

1468
02:02:06,441 --> 02:02:11,650
gave me is the one I saw on the beach. The
one that I saw on the girl’s face as she

1469
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:17,440
loomed over Nik. Before diving into the water
and disappearing, only a tail fin popping

1470
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,840
up from the waves.

1471
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:22,690
“You can’t stay,” I say.

1472
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:24,890
She nods, her eyes nervous.

1473
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:27,960
“You’re not a witch, are you?”

1474
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:30,140
She shakes her head no.

1475
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:34,460
“You’re a mermaid.”

1476
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:42,210
10
“HOW IS HE—THE BOY?” ANNEMETTE SWALLOWS

1477
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:44,710
HARD and takes a step toward me.

1478
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:50,080
I instinctively take a step back, bumping
into the table behind me and knocking a corked

1479
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:55,320
vial of octopus ink on its side. I’m not
sure if it’s Tante Hansa’s old wives’

1480
02:02:55,320 --> 02:03:00,270
tales telling me to run or the fact that Annemette
is clearly more powerful than any folktale

1481
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:06,330
could have ever described. My hand reaches
out and grasps the vial before it rolls and

1482
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:13,380
smashes to the floor. The pearl at my neck
throbs. I want to leave, but her face looks

1483
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:19,280
pained, and I can see now that she’s been
holding this question in since she arrived.

1484
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:24,860
I realize she’s not here for me or my magic.
She’s here for Nik.

1485
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:30,851
In my stunned silence, Annemette goes on.
“Is he all right? He was breathing when

1486
02:03:30,851 --> 02:03:37,300
I brought him ashore, but I didn’t have
time to—you came and then that man, and

1487
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:43,540
I had to go. I need him to be alive, Evie.
Please, say something!”

1488
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:52,050
I nod. “He’s fine. You saved him.” My
throat tightens and tears sting my cheeks.

1489
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:58,330
If it wasn’t for Annemette, I’d be dressed
in mourning clothes. “He’s totally healthy.

1490
02:03:58,330 --> 02:04:02,340
Strapping. Probably milking a goat at this
very moment!”

1491
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:08,610
Annemette practically collapses in my arms.
“Oh, thank goodness! When he fell into the

1492
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:12,830
sea, I caught him, but the tide and the storm
was so strong, I—”

1493
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:18,110
“Stop. I shouldn’t know,” I say. “You
shouldn’t say any more. It’s too dangerous

1494
02:04:18,110 --> 02:04:19,110
for me to—”

1495
02:04:19,110 --> 02:04:25,100
“But you aren’t any more welcome here
than I am,” she says, pulling herself upright.

1496
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:32,000
“Your magic is just as forbidden as mine.”
And when my eyes meet hers and they’re clear

1497
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:38,320
and hard, I realize we’ve made an exchange.
A dangerous one.

1498
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:45,670
I know her secret and she knows mine. Breaking
this trust would ensure our mutual demise.

1499
02:04:45,670 --> 02:04:49,740
I slip the vial of ink I’d been clutching
into my dress pocket.

1500
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:52,760
We will only survive our secrets together.

1501
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:58,870
“I promise I won’t say a thing,” I assure
her, a hint of regret in my voice.

1502
02:04:58,870 --> 02:05:04,860
“Thank you,” she says. “My lips are
sealed too.” She weaves a slim finger through

1503
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:11,190
her blond hair, twisting a long wave into
a curl. “What’s his name—the boy?”

1504
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:17,350
“Nik. His name is Nik. And he’s my best
friend. I’m so glad that you were there.

1505
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:23,320
I saw the wave too late, and he was gone.”
I realize for the first time that after saving

1506
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:28,400
Nik over and over again, even if it was only
on the dance floor, there was nothing I could

1507
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:34,760
have done that night. That he’d have saved
me from the sea, but I would have failed him.

1508
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:39,760
My smile falters and I look down to the gray
oysters at our feet. “I wish I could repay

1509
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:43,470
you with more than a few scraps of food and
a pearl necklace.”

1510
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:50,050
Annemette loops a finger in mine. It feels
strange, too close, but I don’t want to

1511
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:57,020
push her away. “I didn’t do anything special,”
she says. “Mermaids are not the monsters

1512
02:05:57,020 --> 02:06:00,880
you humans think we are. I could not just
let him drown.”

1513
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:07,700
Drown. Like Anna did. Like I thought Anna
did.

1514
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:15,800
At this moment, Annemette looks so pretty.
So innocent. She raises her eyes to meet mine.

1515
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,060
“Would you like to meet him?” I ask.

1516
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:17,560
“Please,” she says.
