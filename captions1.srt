1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,819
I ask.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,779
“Please,” she says.

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:11,000
We leave my “lair” and make our way back
through the rocks, Annemette still nervous

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,250
as she heads out first. So strange and sad
to see a mermaid afraid of the sea. As I go,

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,529
I pause in the water for a moment—I want
to take a last look at the cave to make sure

6
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,359
all is hidden—and that’s when I feel them.
At my feet, three dead minnows bounce between

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,250
my ankle and the boulder—surely knocked
out of the sea by a wild wave and smacked

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,160
into the rocks. I shake my head, remembering
the last time such fish floated at my feet,

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,719
but I can’t think of that day. Not now.

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,180
On the shore, Annemette and I dry off and
put on our shoes. Then we head back up the

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,500
trail through the forest. Once the trees spread
out enough and we have room to walk side by

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,539
side, I feel as if I can finally ask her more.
“So, have you always been a mermaid?”

13
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,960
Annemette gives me a look. “Have you always
been a girl?”

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,280
“Yes,” I reply. “But you’re no longer
a mermaid. At least, I don’t see a tail.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,130
Perhaps you weren’t one from the start.”

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,880
She laughs, and I almost draw back because
she sounds just like Anna again. Our elbows

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,060
bump as I check myself, wishing I’d just
asked her directly what I wanted to know.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,940
“Sorry to disappoint you,” she says. “Born
a mermaid, hopefully not forever one.” She

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,700
dances gracefully into an arabesque pose.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,791
I stop walking. My brows pull together. My
courage rises. “But is it possible, for

21
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:49,470
a human to drown and become a merperson?”

22
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,520
She shakes her head and I reset.

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,530
“How long can you stay like that?”

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,280
Annemette glances down for a moment and then
her eyes are up and locked with mine. “A

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,280
few minutes,” she says, her back leg still
high in the air.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,710
“No, I mean, how long can you stay human?”

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:15,220
Her eyes shift at the word. She stands up
straight and stretches. “Not long,” she

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,610
says after a pause. “At least not as I am.
But it depends.”

29
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,150
“Depends on what?” I push back.

30
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,480
“I promise to tell you,” she says, though
I can see in her hesitation that she doesn’t

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,510
quite trust me. Her face turns pale and she
almost looks scared—lost, even. “It’s

32
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,060
just that I have to see Nik first, or none
of it will matter.”

33
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:48,120
The little pearl pulses against my neck—líf.
Her magic is strong, but good. She saved his

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,110
life. The least I can do is make an introduction.
I glance quickly at the sun on its descent

35
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,819
toward the mountains. “We should get going.
The Lithasblot festivities will start soon,”

36
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,050
I say. “It’s our harvest festival. People
come from all over. They’ve even heard of

37
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,210
us in Copenhagen, I swear.”

38
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,110
“Sounds fun,” Annemette says. “And Nik
will be there?”

39
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:18,260
I nod yes. If she tries anything, I have Tante
Hansa’s and my mother’s magic in my blood.

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,280
She grasps my hand tight.

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,010
“Let’s go.”

42
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,280
When we come upon the beach where tonight’s
festivities are, the palace staff and some

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,990
local villagers are still setting up. We’re
a little early. The livestock stage is being

44
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,150
nailed together, and a hundred or so people
are milling about fixing decorations, laying

45
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,890
out food, and tending the bonfire, where soon
a giant hog will be trussed up on a spit.

46
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,150
“It’s not Copenhagen, but it is a kingdom,
I suppose. As the sun goes down, the beach

47
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,849
will be so full you can barely see a grain
of sand.”

48
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:58,340
“We have some pretty good parties on the
sand where I come from too.”

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,240
I laugh. “I’m sure you do.”

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,630
Suddenly Annemette walks up to the fire and
holds out her hands. I forget that she’s

51
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,760
never seen fire like this before.

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,780
“Whoa there, young lady,” says Herre Olsen,
the tailor, pushing Annemette back before

53
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,139
I can get to her. “Any closer and you’ll
soon be roasting with the hog.”

54
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,470
“Thank you,” Annemette says with a curtsy.
“I’m sorry.”

55
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,370
“Who are you here with?” he asks.

56
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,840
“I’m visiting for the festival with—”

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,990
“Me,” I interject, steering her away from
the scowl on the tailor’s face. “Thank

58
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,410
you, Herre Olsen.

59
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,500
“We need to give you a better backstory,”
I whisper, guiding her toward the castle grounds.

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,530
The townspeople like to talk, especially about
me, but the king and queen will need something

61
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,990
substantial if their son is going to be seen
speaking to her. A lowly girl without a house

62
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,290
name is not good enough; I would know.

63
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,810
We decide to give her the title of a baron’s
daughter, the same title Anna had: friherrinde.

64
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,840
A friherrinde from far away—Odense—come
to see our unusual Lithasblot. Her chaperone

65
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,920
has fallen ill, and Tante Hansa is tending
to her. I’m filling in as her chaperone

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,910
and guide. Yes. It’ll work. Another lie
added to the list. I suppose there’s some

67
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,470
truth behind the town gossips whispering that
I spread falsehoods, saying the prince should

68
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,290
not trust me. But telling the truth to gain
their approval is not a risk I’m willing

69
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,290
to take.

70
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,780
“When will we see Nik?” Annemette asks,
tired of reciting her story to me.

71
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,010
“Don’t worry.” I point to the giant
stone monstrosity on the hill. “He’s waiting

72
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,220
for me up there.”

73
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,450
Annemette follows my finger.

74
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:56,639
“Øldenburg Castle,” I say. “Five hundred
years old and as drafty as a sailboat.”

75
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,870
I guide her to the queen’s garden, which
is rich with tulips of every color. Annemette

76
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,630
proclaims each one the most beautiful thing
she’s ever seen until she gets to the next

77
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,270
one. And the next. “I love to garden,”
she says.

78
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,030
Her mouth drops with a gasp when we get to
the queen’s pride and joy—statutes of

79
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,400
her family, each taller than a horse, circled
up among the tulips. The king and queen are

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,330
fashioned as they were on their wedding day,
the marble smooth and glistening from the

81
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,650
years. And there, next to them, is the latest
version of Nik—eleven feet tall and chiseled

82
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,340
as if lunging across the bow of a great sea
vessel.

83
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,570
“Is that . . . him?”

84
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,530
She stands on her tippy toes, fingertips not
even getting so far as his tastefully unbuttoned

85
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,530
collar.

86
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,390
“Yes, yes, that’s him.”

87
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:56,190
“He looks different than I remember. Drier,
I guess.” She laughs.

88
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,550
We crest the steps and there, already waiting
and watching Havnestad Harbor, is Nik. He’s

89
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,610
freshly washed after his trip to the farms,
the light crown he’s forced to wear for

90
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,130
festival days pressed down over his wet hair.
I always think he looks ridiculous all fancy

91
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,889
in Havnestad’s customary blue-and-gold suit,
but Queen Charlotte is from the fjords up

92
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,300
north and very traditional. She insists he
emulate his official portrait for the high

93
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,110
holidays of the Old Norse.

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,620
“Evie, there you are,” he says, catching
me first in his line of sight as he turns

95
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,931
from the view. When his eyes land on Annemette,
his face freezes on her features. All except

96
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:43,820
his lips, which are still moving ever so slightly.
“And you’ve brought a friend . . .”

97
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:50,870
I smile and guide her toward him. “Your
Royal Highness, this is Friherrinde Annemette.

98
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,080
Annemette, this is Crown Prince Niklas.”

99
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,970
A light zips through Nik’s eyes as he meets
Annemette’s gaze. At first I think that

100
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,730
he recognizes her—that he instantly realizes
she’s the one who saved him. Or that he

101
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,889
sees the old friend we lost, the first half
of this girl’s name ringing in his ears.

102
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,930
But almost immediately it’s clear that he’s
thinking of neither, because he does something

103
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:25,199
I’ve never seen before. He blushes hard.
Honest-to-Urda heat is rising in his cheeks,

104
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,479
and it’s so intense that he has to glance
at me before looking down.

105
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,610
He thinks she’s beautiful.

106
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,610
And she is—she’s gorgeous—but this . . . this
is unprecedented.

107
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,809
I’m ashamed to admit the pang of jealousy
radiating in my chest. So often, I’m the

108
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,220
only one who has Nik’s attention, and he’s
never looked at me like that. But I suppose

109
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,399
if he had, we wouldn’t be friends. Is this
how he feels when I’m with Iker? Ugh, I

110
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:01,410
do not want to think about Iker. I smile at
them both, standing awkwardly between them,

111
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,179
wanting to run away but afraid for what might
happen if I did.

112
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:10,480
“Enchanted,” he says when the words finally
kick in, the blush still hearty along his

113
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,629
cheekbones. “How do you know Evie? I thought
I knew all of her friends.”

114
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:21,939
I cut in to answer him. “Her chaperone became
ill on their trip from Odense. Tante Hansa

115
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:27,720
is seeing to her. Annemette very much wanted
to attend a proper Lithasblot festival, so

116
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,149
I’ve become her guide.” I touch her arm.
“And meeting the crown prince is quite the

117
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,360
way to start, isn’t it, Annemette?”

118
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,129
She grins. “Yes, it most certainly is.”

119
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:47,429
Nik’s color begins to normalize, his training
rushing in on a white horse to rescue him.

120
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:55,639
His humor, too. “Well, I am quite the carnival
show. Over six feet tall and solid muscle.”

121
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,660
He raises a wiry arm and pats the bicep. “I
have a gaggle of followers trailing after

122
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,350
me like ducklings, just so I can open sticky
canning jars.”

123
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,899
I wink at Annemette. “It’s true; I’ll
have no one else open my troublesome jars.”

124
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:19,639
There, I’m being a good friend. To them
both. I’m okay with this. Really, I am.

125
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:25,939
Annemette continues to smile but looks a little
confused. She knows a lot about this world,

126
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,920
but not so much that she might know a canning
jar from a regular one. I smile at Nik and

127
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,420
do my best to save her. “So, are there jars
on the agenda at the moment, Crown Prince

128
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,209
Niklas, or shall we go gawk at some livestock?”

129
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:45,019
“You really don’t have to call me Crown
Prince Niklas—just Nik,” he says, eyes

130
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:51,399
on Annemette. “Evie’s just joking. I don’t
care much for titles.” He touches his crown

131
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,550
and then blushes again. “Crowns, either
. . .”

132
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,649
Annemette nods. “What do you care for?”

133
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,019
“Music, mostly.”

134
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:06,809
“I love to sing.” I swallow as she says
this, my eyes unable to see anything other

135
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:12,660
than the friend she insists she’s not. The
girl who had the voice of an angel—ask anyone

136
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,649
in Havnestad.

137
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,420
But rather than looking heartsick, Nik begins
to blush again. A sheepish smile spreads across

138
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,220
his face. “Then I shall use my princely
power to borrow an instrument later and accompany

139
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,879
you.”

140
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,759
My stomach churns. This is perfect. Just perfect.

141
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,839
We stroll down the steps and into the garden.
I see him duck away for a moment and pluck

142
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,100
a pink tulip from the end of the row, where
the queen won’t notice it. Annemette dips

143
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,690
down to smell her favorites.

144
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,430
I step away and watch as he strides up to
her lowered form, flower behind his back.

145
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,040
When she stands and turns, he pulls the pink
tulip from where it’s hidden and lowers

146
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,149
into a slight, princely bow.

147
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,709
Annemette’s mouth drops open into a wide
smile and her eyes snap to his.

148
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,300
“Really? I can have it?”

149
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,540
“What good is being a prince if I can’t
pluck a tulip from my own garden?”

150
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,189
“Oh, thank you! This one is my favorite.”

151
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:21,209
“You are most welcome, Annemette.” Her
fingers snatch it away, and she lifts it to

152
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,800
her nose, inhaling deeply.

153
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:33,029
When her eyes open, I catch them and smile.
“To the festival, shall we?”

154
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,790
11
NIK CHOKES DOWN WHAT MUST BE HIS TENTH spandauer,

155
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:45,569
the flaky sweet pastry sticking to his lips.
As we walk around the festival, Nik is stopped

156
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:52,149
at practically every turn to taste each table’s
offerings. Whether it’s cheeses both old

157
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,880
and stinky, berries and stone fruit from the
valley orchards, crusty breads of rye and

158
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,079
barley, split-pea delicacies attempting to
rival Hansa’s famous soup, or the tables

159
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:09,600
and tables of desserts, Nik is required to
try them all. He assures the vendors that

160
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,329
whatever he’s just shoved down his gullet
is the best in all of Havnestad, possibly

161
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,009
in all of the Øresund Kingdoms.

162
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:21,860
“Save me, Evie,” he grumbles after his
last bite.

163
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,379
Why don’t you ask her? I want to say as
Annemette walks next to me, but instead I

164
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,679
hand him my mother’s handkerchief. “Take
small bites and then use this.”

165
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:40,730
My mood hasn’t much improved, though I’m
trying. It helps that Annemette’s porcelain

166
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,929
face has gone gray, the seafood our town is
known for churning her stomach. We pass by

167
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:52,579
tables selling pitch-black whale meat and
pale-pink blubber, lobster bright red and

168
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:59,360
still warm from boiling, soft-fleshed crab,
salty salmon roe, even slices of slow-roasted

169
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,549
eel.

170
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:06,569
At the next table, Annemette grabs my hand
and leans into my ear. “Why do you kill

171
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:10,410
all the sea life if the other options are
so vast?”

172
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:18,519
I shrug. “It’s our way of life. Havnestad
lives and dies by its nets and harpoons.”

173
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,759
I suppose I should be sympathetic, but it’s
hot, and all this stopping and going has made

174
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,329
me even sourer.

175
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,980
Her brow furrows. “But there is so much
else to eat.”

176
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,970
She leans in, her whisper growing softer as
Nik tries to shake off yet another local culinary

177
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,279
wizard. “My father always tells us to stay
far from the surface, scares us with tales

178
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:49,369
of our kind being split in two by harpoons,
talks about humans as the scourge of the seas,

179
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,329
always hunting and killing. But this . . .”

180
00:14:52,329 --> 00:15:00,100
“It’s the way it is, Annemette,” I say
as gently as I would to a child. In some ways

181
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,739
that is what she is, even if she’s my age.
The time she’s been in my world can easily

182
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:11,369
be measured in hours. “We are all surviving
as best we can. We don’t mean harm to the

183
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,329
sea life, or the pig, or anything else.”

184
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,869
“I was unprepared.”

185
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:23,799
“I was unprepared to meet a mermaid today,”
I whisper, my words just an inch from her

186
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,739
ear. “But I did.”

187
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:32,239
She laughs into the falling night. Nik glances
over at us, and I raise a brow at him and

188
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:38,619
purse my lips. He grins at Annemette but then
catches my eye again and I know he suspects

189
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:43,439
I’m feeding her girl talk. And I’ll just
let him go ahead and think that.

190
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:49,859
Nik tears himself away from the latest onslaught,
a plate thrust into his hand, fried torsk

191
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:55,830
dripping with fresh fat, heat rising from
its body, head still on, beady little fish

192
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,459
eyes staring vacantly into space.

193
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:05,609
“Fru Ulla insists this is the best torsk
in all of Havnestad—possibly all of Denmark,

194
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:12,259
to hear her tell it. If you seek a true Lithasblot
experience, Annemette, this is where to start.”

195
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:17,259
I touch the plate and press it toward his
chest, where it is safely out of the way.

196
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,499
“She doesn’t eat fish.”

197
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:23,980
Nik laughs. “Who doesn’t eat fish? We’re
Danes—”

198
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,829
“Allergy,” I say. “If she has fish,
she’ll blow up like one of those French

199
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,079
flying balloons.”

200
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,689
“It is terrible,” Annemette says, coming
to life and puffing out her cheeks.

201
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:42,730
The questions die on Nik’s lips. Without
hesitation, he drops the plate into the open

202
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,999
hands of a chubby little boy, who grins wide-eyed
and then hurries after his family. “Then

203
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:53,639
it will be my sworn duty to protect you from
Havnestad’s affinity for sea life.”

204
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,000
Annemette’s eyes skip to mine and then back
to Nik’s in one swift motion. “The brave

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
crown prince you are, indeed.”

206
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,010
Long after the fire has died down and the
largest bull from Aleksander Jessen’s farm

207
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,310
has been crowned this year’s winner, Nik,
Annemette, and I sit on the end of the royal

208
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,030
dock, eyes on the ocean and music in the air.

209
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:25,579
Nik plays a basic rhythm on the guitaren and
Annemette chooses the words—picking old

210
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,211
sailors’ songs that they apparently know
under the sea as well as we do on land. This

211
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:34,040
one is their play on “Come, All Ye Sailors
Bold.”

212
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,810
“The king trusts to his sailors bold, and
we shall find them as of old—for father,

213
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,480
mother, sisters, wives, we’re ready now
to risk our lives . . .”

214
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,800
I sit beside them with my eyes on the waves,
surprisingly enjoying the clear quality of

215
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,450
Annemette’s voice. It’s as beautiful as
Anna’s ever was, rich and high, with a lovely

216
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,390
air of innocence built into the base of each
note.

217
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:10,230
“For Danish girls with eyes so blue, we’ll
do all that sailors do. And Dannébrog upon

218
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,350
our masts, shall float as long as this world
lasts . . .”

219
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,540
They are sitting so close together that the
fold of her skirt is touching his trousers.

220
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,580
Neither seems to mind, and if anything, they
drift closer as the minutes pass. I am on

221
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,880
Nik’s other side, and with each song, laugh,
and snippet of conversation, the gap of roughhewn

222
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,450
dock grows between us.

223
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,160
While I’m glad that Nik is happy and that
Annemette seems to have found what she was

224
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,140
looking for, I can’t shake this gray cloud
of self-pity, engulfing me like a fog descending

225
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,810
on the harbor. It was so easy for Annemette
to make that connection with Nik, and no one

226
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,420
thought anything of it. There were smiles
all around as they walked arm in arm, each

227
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:03,130
townsperson remarking on her beauty, how nice
they looked together. I stalked beside them.

228
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,050
The chaperone.

229
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:11,320
I know in this moment that I will never find
what they have if I stay in Havnestad. I merely

230
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,910
speak to anyone outside my station and there
are calls to lock me up in the brig. I wish

231
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,740
Iker were here, but it’s clear that even
if he is by my side, it’ll always just be

232
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,610
a childhood fantasy. He may not care what
the others think when he’s with me, but

233
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,900
when it comes down to it, he’ll marry a
highborn daughter, and that will be that.

234
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,410
I will be alone again.

235
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,790
If only Anna were here. The true Anna. Maybe
things would be different.

236
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,890
The tune comes to a natural end, Nik and Annemette
falling into each other in a fit of laughter.

237
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:53,140
“You have the most lovely voice, Mette,”
he says, using a shortened version of her

238
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,581
name I didn’t know she preferred. I wonder
when she told him to call her that. Or maybe

239
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:04,500
he just did it, feeling an instant familiarity
with her that I don’t have.

240
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,000
“Much obliged, Nik.” She bends at the
waist. A sitting curtsy. That’s a new one.

241
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,070
“We must do this again tomorrow, Mette.
Please tell me you will be here tomorrow.”

242
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,950
“Yes, yes, of course I will be.” Annemette’s
face beams in the moonlight.

243
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,860
“Excellent. Shall I send a coach round to
your room in the morning? Where are you staying?”

244
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,840
“With me,” I say, the lie we planned ready.
“Her chaperone is quite ill.”

245
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,670
Nik’s brows furrow with concern, or maybe
it’s doubt. He grows quiet for a moment,

246
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,660
and I’d wish he’d speak.

247
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,180
“But then Mette might grow ill,” he says
finally, and I release the breath I didn’t

248
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,340
know I was holding. “And you too, Evie.
You both can stay at the palace. I insist.”

249
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,040
He turns to me, grin in place, though my face
must reflect sheer shock. We’re best friends,

250
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,620
but the line in the sand between us has always
been the palace. I’ve never stayed there—Queen

251
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,090
Charlotte even sent me home the night he nearly
drowned. “I’ll message Hansa and have

252
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,090
your trunks brought round.”

253
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:16,540
No. That won’t work. Because then he’ll
know Annemette has no trunk—she has nothing

254
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:23,070
but the clothes on her back. “No worries,
I’ll get them!” I blurt. “Hansa is too

255
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,020
busy to pack her things.”

256
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,650
Nik nods, having gotten what he wanted, the
trunks a mere formality.

257
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:36,030
Annemette grasps my hands and looks me in
the eye. “Thank you,” she says. There’s

258
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,610
a sincerity in her voice, tinged with desperation
that I haven’t heard since she first asked

259
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,770
if Nik was alive.

260
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:50,140
Right. She saved him, and she came here to
see him. She had her reasons.

261
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,690
I could kick myself for being so petulant
and bitter all night, even if only I noticed.

262
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:02,650
But at least I, too, have achieved my aim.
Repaying her good deed with their introduction.

263
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:08,320
And it seems to be worth a lot to her. To
both of them. Yet still my stomach flutters,

264
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,930
the dock moving as if I’m adrift past the
strait, alone on the open sea.

265
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:23,390
12
I DON’T WANT QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO GET

266
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:29,250
UP TO the castle before the queen finds out
about Nik’s invitation. Our lie about Annemette’s

267
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,990
noble heritage passed Nik’s scrutiny, but
he wanted to believe us. His mother, well,

268
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,700
I wouldn’t put it past her to know the name
of every noble this side of Prussia.

269
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,870
At the cottage, I blow through the entryway
like I’ll hurtle through the back window,

270
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,320
through the trees, and off the cliff, but
at the last moment, I veer down the hall and

271
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,350
into my bedroom.

272
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,030
My grand entry does not escape Tante Hansa,
despite the fact that she was surely deep

273
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,220
in her thoughts as she distilled octopus ink
by candlelight.

274
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,490
“Was that a tempest or my sister’s child
bursting through the house?” she asks, coming

275
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,150
down the hall.

276
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,030
I ignore her, shutting my door before plowing
through my chest of drawers for all the proper

277
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:21,940
pieces of a wardrobe—stays, undergarments,
stockings, boots, dress. I shove in the latest

278
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,820
book of magic I stole from Hansa’s library—Myths
of Maritime—too. There might be something

279
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,390
in there about mermaids that would be worth
a look.

280
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,940
Within a minute, Hansa opens the door. Immediately,
her arms cross and her brows pull together.

281
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,970
“You aren’t going to smuggle your entire
closet out in that trunk, my dear.”

282
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,390
“Who said I was smuggling it?”

283
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,730
Tante Hansa takes a step forward, lips drawn
into a perturbed line.

284
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,450
“The bloomers poking out the front.”

285
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,960
Sure enough, the ruched ankle of an undergarment
is sticking out of my trunk like a dead man’s

286
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,090
tongue.

287
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:06,030
Hansa tilts her head a bit, one brow now impossibly
raised. “Are you going to tell me why you

288
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,490
are rushing in and out of here with enough
clothes for an entire week at sea? It wouldn’t

289
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,770
have to do with your new friend, would it?”

290
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,190
The thought skips to the front of my mind
to tell her. If anyone would believe that

291
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:25,530
Annemette is a mermaid, it would be Tante
Hansa. But I can’t tell.

292
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,912
“Well, child? Have you formed the perfect
bluff in your pretty little head? You’ve

293
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,700
had more than enough time.”

294
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,250
“It’s not a bluff. Nik’s asked me to
stay at the castle—Annemette, too.”

295
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:45,640
That earns me an ancient Hansa chuckle. “His
festival duties have the boy in such a tizzy

296
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,480
that he needs to sleep with moral support
down the hall, does he?”

297
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,850
“Something like that,” I say, though I
know Tante Hansa isn’t buying it.

298
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:02,770
The brow arches higher. “Are you certain
that cad from Rigeby Bay hasn’t arrived

299
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,410
with promises on his lips and a night’s
lodging at the castle?”

300
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,320
Heat creeps up my cheeks.

301
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,670
In my dreams.

302
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:17,310
“Iker still hasn’t arrived.” I’m not
sure he will at all, I add in my thoughts,

303
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,400
but I manage to keep my features plain despite
the pang I feel in my chest. “And Nik has

304
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,240
requested my—our—presence tonight in his
stead.”

305
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,950
“Oh, he’s requested, now, has he?” Tante
Hansa peers down her long nose like a blue

306
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,710
heron. “So princely after one canned speech
that he’s now requesting the presence of

307
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,490
his little fish-rat friend?”

308
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,150
“You know Nik’s not like that. Besides,
you come when you’re called—‘Healer

309
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,260
of Kings,’ is it?”

310
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:54,270
“Don’t make this about me, child. I know
what I’m doing.” She laughs again as I

311
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,310
lug the chest toward the door. Annemette will
be nearly finished with the grand tour by

312
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,980
now. If Nik’s been ratted out by a member
of the staff, the queen won’t go to bed

313
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,230
without addressing him.

314
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,350
“Are you finished with me?” I take a step
toward the door she’s blocking.

315
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,420
“No, I’m not finished with you.” She
crosses her arms for a moment, looking stern,

316
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,200
but then backs away from the door, leaving
a sliver for escape. “But you are just as

317
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,370
stubborn as your mother, and if you fight
me as long as she would have, I’ll be in

318
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,060
this doorway until dawn.”

319
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:35,350
I take another step toward her and lean in
as much as my belongings will allow, planting

320
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,410
a kiss on her papery cheek.

321
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,510
“Good night, Tante Hansa.”

322
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,550
I stride past her, past her smelly inks, and
out the door. I’m not one step beyond the

323
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,130
threshold when I hear her call, “Don’t
grant all the prince’s requests, darling

324
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,140
girl. Men are always asking for more than
they should.”

325
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:03,850
Though I’m not with Father on one of his
fish deliveries, it seems too strange to walk

326
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:09,470
through the main entrance of Øldenburg Castle.
There are some things that are just not for

327
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:15,730
me as a commoner. Malvina Christensen and
her ilk might think I don’t know my place,

328
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,030
but I do. It’s evident every day.

329
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:24,450
I’m angling through the tulip garden, the
trunk dragging along at my feet, when I hear

330
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,590
my name.

331
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:31,280
It’s nearly midnight, but Queen Charlotte
looks just as regal as ever, still in the

332
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,260
full evening gown she wore at the festival,
crown nestled in her perfectly styled hair.

333
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,200
I catch Nik approaching behind her.

334
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,430
“Evelyn,” says the queen, the distaste
in her voice not hard to miss. “Niklas told

335
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:52,700
me you’d be joining us.” She eyes her
son, and I know he had to fight for me to

336
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,610
stay. “It was gracious of Friherrinde Annemette
to suggest you stay in the same room.”

337
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:06,020
“She’s very gracious indeed, as are you
for having us, Your Highness,” I say. The

338
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,910
queen nods as if I’ve passed a test—I
know how she prefers to be praised.

339
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:18,630
“My pleasure,” she says, and steps away.
But then she pauses and turns. “Please stay

340
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,790
within this wing.”

341
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,480
I nod. Yes, I know my place.

342
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,990
Once the queen is gone, Nik rushes to my side.

343
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,340
“Let me help you.”

344
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,800
“I’ve got it.” But just as I say it,
he’s snuck a hand on either handle and hoisted

345
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,280
the thing to his chest, as effortless as can
be.

346
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,990
“You shouldn’t. You’re still recovering!”

347
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,230
“I’m fine. It’s practice for the rock
carry—I have to defend my title.”

348
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:51,190
“Since when do you care about winning so
much?” I goad him so we don’t have to

349
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,410
talk about his mother.

350
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,760
“Turns out a taste of victory is all I needed
to care.”

351
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,110
“Or the need to impress a girl. Speaking
of . . . where is she?”

352
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:07,720
Nik takes a step toward the door, and I rush
ahead of him to open it. “Mette was so enamored

353
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,860
with her room; it was so sweet, I didn’t
want to disturb her. Besides, Mother . . .”

354
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,460
His voice trails off as a guard comes to help,
taking the trunk from Nik’s hands. Nik grabs

355
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,900
the edge of the door above my head, relieving
me of my duty. For a moment, I stand there

356
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,720
trying to read his face, because it’s not
as clear and open as I’m used to seeing.

357
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,480
His emotions are all muddled, like Hansa’s
magical ink swirling across the surface of

358
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
water.

359
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,309
Nik looks over at the guard. “Take her trunk
to the Baroque Room, please, Oleg.”

360
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:49,920
Oleg nods, and Nik pulls me back outside and
onto the steps. He sits down on the top step,

361
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,220
and I follow. His shoulder nestles next to
mine and his voice is low.

362
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:01,530
“Apparently coming of age means more than
giving speeches,” he says without preamble,

363
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,670
his eyes on his hands.

364
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,620
My heart starts pounding and my hand finds
his shoulder. “Nik . . .”

365
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,740
“Mother is pleased because Annemette is
the first of her ‘girls’ to arrive.”

366
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,140
My mouth goes dry. I should’ve seen this
coming—among so many other things these

367
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:26,780
past few days. Annemette must have passed
the queen’s scrutiny, my aid unneeded.

368
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,470
“She had her ladies send letters to every
high house in Denmark, inviting every princess,

369
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:39,600
komtesse, and friherrinde to the Lithasblot
Ball and God knows what else. Now that I’m

370
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,240
sixteen, I should be courting, but Mother
thought it wise to bring the girls to me.”

371
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,200
“Oh, Nik—” I start, but then he stares
up at me, and the look in his eyes makes my

372
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
throat catch.

373
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,380
“Lured them in with Iker’s presence, too
. . .”

374
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:03,580
Of course: the playboy prince, two years older,
with brave tales of the sea. I bet every last

375
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,460
girl with a title is on a steamer right now.

376
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:12,491
“Two princes for the price of one—we’re
the market special,” he says. “No wonder

377
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:14,810
Iker’s still at sea.”

378
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,970
He’s careful to smile at his joke—he’s
trying to save my feelings. But I can’t

379
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:26,570
grin back, not even a little bit. I want so
badly to turn to stone like the statues in

380
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,620
his mother’s garden. There must be a spell
for that, no? At least then I wouldn’t have

381
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,330
this rot of disappointment creeping up inside
me. It turns out knowing better doesn’t

382
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,710
always help. It makes it worse.

383
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:46,360
It’s funny, though—maybe funny isn’t
the right word, but Nik and I are both trapped.

384
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,890
I’ll forever be the fisherman’s daughter,
caught in a web of whispers and lies spread

385
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,510
by those too scared to open their eyes and
see beyond what’s in front of their faces.

386
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:02,570
And Nik—he’ll be locked in by royal traditions,
forced into a loveless match with someone

387
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,620
only out for the crown. Nik will always be
in the shadow of the castle. And nothing I

388
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,400
can do will save him from that.

389
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,320
Except, if the queen already believes Annemette’s
story, surely Annemette is better than these

390
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:24,270
komtesses flocking to our shores. She does
seem to make Nik happy. I know it’s only

391
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:28,800
been a day, but even I’ll admit that I’ve
never seen Nik smile as much as he has with

392
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,760
her. It’s not everything, but it’s a start.
And she’s not after his crown. That I know.

393
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:43,510
She genuinely cares. She saved him. Besides,
it might serve us all well to finally have

394
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,270
some magic in the palace, to perhaps bring
an end to Queen Charlotte’s brutal warnings

395
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:54,390
and doll burnings. Maybe as a trusted friend
to both the crown prince and princess, I wouldn’t

396
00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:00,660
be relegated to the kitchen door. My family
would not have to live in secret. If Annemette

397
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:07,030
makes Nik truly happy, we can both be free.
Stop, Evie. You’re getting ahead of yourself.

398
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,670
But a smile pulls on my lips all the same.

399
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:21,030
“Let’s go inside,” I say to him. “Everything
will be okay. Annemette is waiting.”

400
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:27,220
13
I WAKE IN THE BLUE LIGHT OF THE MORNING AND

401
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,850
SIT straight up. I thought a night in the
royal wing, on the most comfortable mattress

402
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,929
I’ve ever slept on, would do me well, but
it hasn’t. I’m anxious.

403
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:43,720
I’ve smuggled a mermaid into the palace,
for Urda’s sake!

404
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:50,370
In the bed across the room, Annemette sleeps,
a ruffle of blond waves piled about her face.

405
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,120
One foot has escaped the bedspread, five toes
stretching lazily toward the ceiling.

406
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,640
It’s easy to forget that she’s never slept
in a bed before. I throw off the covers and

407
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,650
tiptoe to my trunk, left by Oleg next to the
double-sided wardrobe. And there, beneath

408
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:12,839
my underthings, is the book I threw in at
the last minute. Though the name isn’t too

409
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:17,800
suspect—Myths of Maritime—I suppose it’s
lucky we arrived so late in the evening that

410
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,609
the maid couldn’t unpack the trunk. I should’ve
been more careful, though.

411
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:27,230
I crawl onto the plush red window seat and
hold the book up to the new day’s light,

412
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,940
thumbing through the pages for anything about
mermaids. I know all the lore from childhood,

413
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:38,309
of course. I can still hear Tante Hansa’s
voice reciting the tales over the campfire.

414
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:44,799
Mermaids call sailors into storms, their siren
songs and beauty too difficult to ignore.

415
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:50,929
Probably a myth. Annemette is beautiful, but
she didn’t force Nik into the sea, and I’d

416
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,210
be able to tell if she was using magic on
him now. I think.

417
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,180
Then there’s Mermaids can conjure storms
with a blink, sacrificing sailors to please

418
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:07,039
the all-powerful sea. I hope to Urda that
this is not true. A shiver runs up my spine

419
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,920
as I think of Father and Iker.

420
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,210
But the one that always made me and Anna scream
was: Mermaids steal naughty children and feed

421
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:22,540
them to the sharks for protection. Ha! I’ll
let Tante Hansa have that one. It kept me

422
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,010
from making lots of unwise choices, though
I suppose not nearly enough. If only Anna

423
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,049
and I had truly listened.

424
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:36,109
None of this lore is easing my rattled nerves.
The only positive mermaid tale I know is the

425
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:40,980
one I saw with my own eyes: A kind mermaid
may swim you to shore.

426
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,640
But there has to be more written about mermaids
than a few childhood warnings.

427
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,299
After much reading, I finally find a section
on mermaids, following an intensive discussion

428
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:57,760
of the kraken. It doesn’t say much—there’s
just slightly more detail than the descriptions

429
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,660
I know by heart. I focus in on one paragraph.

430
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,829
Accounts of mermaids at the surface often
come with tales of rescue—the saved sailor

431
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:12,820
opening his eyes just as the mermaid dives
back into the waves. The maids are always

432
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,039
described as staying within the water, unable
to leave the sea completely.

433
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:26,880
That was exactly how it happened. Maybe there
will be more on what happens next. I turn

434
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,130
the page, expecting a section on a mermaid’s
ability to change into human form. But there

435
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,990
is nothing. No description, no account, no
guesses at all.

436
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:44,319
I stare at Annemette. She can’t be the first
mermaid to change into a person. She can’t.

437
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:49,230
It just must be so rare there’s not an accurate
tale to pass on.

438
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,710
Possibly feeling the weight of my eyes on
her, Annemette shifts, her arms stretching

439
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,990
high above her head. Her eyes blink open and
she sees me watching her. I expect her to

440
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:06,520
startle, to forget where she is and what she
is, but she doesn’t. Instead, she just yawns.

441
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,220
“I could get used to this.” She rolls
fully toward me. A slim finger points to her

442
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:20,900
calf. “But is it normal that this part just
aches? Burns. And my toes are . . . tingly.”

443
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,869
“Pins and needles?” I offer.

444
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:30,490
“More like knives,” she replies without
hesitation. “But I’ll be fine.” She

445
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,830
pushes herself up a little and yawns again.

446
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:39,049
I set my book between my nightdress and the
windowpane. “Maybe it’s a side effect.

447
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:45,829
You know, of your transformation,” I say.
And now’s my chance: “Have other mermaids

448
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,680
ever turned into humans before?”

449
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,239
“I’m not the first,” she replies. She
stands and turns her back to me as she opens

450
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,450
the wardrobe, revealing a closetful of dresses.

451
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:02,410
“Where’d those come from?” I ask, my
mouth agape as I walk over to the wardrobe.

452
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,529
“I conjured them last night while you were
sleeping.”

453
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:12,609
I want to scold her for doing something so
reckless, but they’re incredible. Silk day

454
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:18,450
dresses in pink, cerulean, and deep purple,
each with little white collars and pearl buttons.

455
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:25,299
I clutch at my necklace and wonder if those
pearls pulse like mine. The evening gowns

456
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:32,490
are even grander. Full skirts and long trains,
gold embroidery, and even beading. They’re

457
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,349
going to think she is the wealthiest friherrinde
in the whole region.

458
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:41,900
“Do you like?” she asks. “Hopefully
they will do the trick.”

459
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,119
I nod eagerly. “What trick?”

460
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,660
“Allowing me to stay,” she says, clutching
a Havnestad-blue dress with mother-of-pearl

461
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,500
inlay. “Don’t you want me to stay?”

462
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,970
“Of course I do, Mette,” I say, trying
out the nickname for the first time. And I

463
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:06,819
realize I mean it. Not only so she can save
Nik from his mother’s misguided intentions,

464
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:11,950
but to have a friend who knows magic, who
knows the real me. I didn’t know how much

465
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:17,500
I wanted that until I met her. “How long
do you have?” I ask, hoping she’ll give

466
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,780
me a real answer this time. “I want to help.”

467
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,579
“The magic lasts four full days,” she
replies. “I have three left.”

468
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:29,380
My face falls. “That’s it?”

469
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:36,309
“But three days becomes forever if, before
midnight on the final day, my true love has

470
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,529
fallen for me, too.”

471
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:39,529
Too.

472
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:40,529
Nik.

473
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,529
Forever.

474
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:50,539
“I love him, Evie. I really do.” Annemette
flops on the bed, no longer the shifty girl

475
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:55,349
holding everything back. More like the girl
I used to talk with about boys and gossip

476
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:01,170
in her own grand room. “He’s why I came
back. I know he can love me. Didn’t you

477
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,640
see us last night?”

478
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,540
“But what if he doesn’t?” I ask. She
turns and stares out the window, out at the

479
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,230
sea far below.

480
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:18,210
“What is it?” I come to her and sit on
her bed. “Tell me, Mette.”

481
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,160
She shakes her head and buries her face in
her hands. When she responds, it’s as if

482
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,780
she’s repeating something she read in a
book—and maybe she is.

483
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:34,579
“To come to land in human form a mermaid
must complete a magical contract—her life

484
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:42,220
as a mermaid for four days on land.” She
pauses and shudders, her chest heaving slightly.

485
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:51,079
“She may not return to the sea after those
four days, for she can never again be a mermaid.”

486
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,030
My stomach practically tumbles to my feet.
“Wait . . . you die?” What kind of dark

487
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:05,249
magic did she do? Nik is wonderful, amazing,
the best guy I know—but to risk her life

488
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:08,049
for someone she barely knows?

489
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:13,920
She sits up and nods. “I know. It’s crazy.
But you don’t get it. He’s what I’ve

490
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:22,089
been missing. I knew he was mine when he fell
into the sea. Into my arms. And to be human?

491
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:25,160
Evie, you don’t know how lucky you are.”

492
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,700
I don’t even know what to think. Of course
I want her to live, and I want them both to

493
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:37,839
be happy, but how can this work? Falling in
love in four days seems . . . unrealistic,

494
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,730
to say the least.

495
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,890
I temper my words carefully. “How can you
tell when he truly loves you?”

496
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:53,099
Annemette’s face goes dreamy again. “True
love’s kiss is all I need.”

497
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:00,779
I almost laugh. Now it’s unrealistic and
ridiculous. So much so, I’m completely incredulous.

498
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:08,289
“A kiss, really? Your life for a kiss? That’s
it? That’s some magic.”

499
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:13,960
“It’s the feeling in the kiss. I’ll
know. The magic will know.”

500
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:23,279
I think of Nik on the steps—enchanted, yes,
but in love? No. Not yet, anyway.

501
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:30,040
I walk back to the window seat. I need space
to breathe, to think. If Annemette hadn’t

502
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,039
risked her life on this, I don’t know how
I’d feel if Nik really did fall in love

503
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:40,380
in three days. The whole thing just feels
wrong—her life depending on Nik somehow

504
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,470
awakening powerful magic, simply by having
enough love in his heart for a girl he’s

505
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:54,079
only just met. One I like, one he likes, one
I’m forever grateful to. But I just don’t

506
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,479
know . . . there has to be another way to
keep her alive without forcing Nik to love

507
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:00,479
her.

508
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,729
When I look up, Annemette is rushing toward
me. She squeezes onto the window seat beside

509
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:10,239
me and takes my hands. The color has drained
from her face.

510
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:16,839
“Evie . . . I’m not encroaching, am I?”
Worry furrows her brow. “You were searching

511
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:22,130
for him that night . . . he was waiting for
you at the palace last evening. He isn’t

512
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,329
. . . ? You don’t . . . ?”

513
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:28,309
“I’m not in love with Nik, and he’s
definitely not in love with me.” I’ve

514
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:34,920
had to say this exact phrase many times, most
recently to Malvina. “We’re just best

515
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
friends.”

516
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,839
She breathes out a sigh, hands fluttering
as she smooths her hair. “You seem so close,

517
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,930
and I didn’t even question . . . you must
think I’m horrible.”

518
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:51,190
“Not at all! Nik and I have been inseparable
for years.” I struggle to make eye contact

519
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,309
here, her closeness again overwhelming. “It’s
a common mistake.”

520
00:43:56,309 --> 00:44:02,000
Relief washes over her, and she sinks back
against the window seat cushions. “Do you

521
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,901
have someone, then? Someone who makes your
heart beat so hard you think it’ll pound

522
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,210
itself out?”

523
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:14,190
Iker’s face flashes in my memory, a wide
smile reaching the ice of his eyes. I bite

524
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:23,670
my lip. “I do—I did. I don’t know.”
Annemette is staring at me for more, so I

525
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:30,960
reluctantly go on. “You saw him—the other
boy on the beach that night.” She nods in

526
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,549
recognition. “Well, he’s Nik’s cousin,
the crown prince of Rigeby Bay. But it doesn’t

527
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:40,910
matter, Mette. He’s away at sea, and we
have more pressing things to consider. Three

528
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:41,910
days . . .”

529
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:49,039
“Oh, Evie, you’re such a good friend,”
Annemette says, pulling me into an embrace.

530
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:55,599
Three days to fall in love. Three days to
live. Three days until the ball every noble

531
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,750
lady in the Øresund Kingdoms will attend.
I shake my head. Finding true love is hard

532
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:08,329
enough without the competition.

533
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:14,710
14
I DON’T KNOW HOW SHE ACTS SO CALM AS WE

534
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:20,030
WALK down to meet Nik for breakfast. It must
be the sea in her veins, flowing against the

535
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:25,130
tide no matter what the weather. My entire
body might as well be one giant bundle of

536
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:31,229
nerves tied up in a sailor’s knot on her
behalf, but Annemette walks out onto the sun-drenched

537
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:37,289
balcony off the third-floor ballroom looking
as enchanting and confident as anyone could,

538
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:43,109
her blue dress casting her eyes a deep ocean
hue and her butter-blond hair shining in the

539
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:44,609
sun.

540
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:49,789
We blink into the bright light and are met
with a spectacular view of the harbor. I know

541
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:54,390
our corner of the sea so well, but it’s
different from this angle, nearly the whole

542
00:45:54,390 --> 00:46:01,440
coast in sight. It’s an empowering view,
to be able to see all that you rule over.

543
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,450
The current is moving faster than usual for
this time of year, and I turn my back, not

544
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,089
wanting to dredge up old memories.

545
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:13,509
“Good morning, ladies. Won’t you have
a seat?” Nik stands and pulls out the chair

546
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:16,280
to his right. “Mette?”

547
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,430
Annemette blushes and takes the coveted place.
I push my nerves down and greet him with a

548
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:28,229
wink as he pulls out my chair. It’s then
that I see he’s a bit red himself, that

549
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:34,260
blush from last night back again at the sight
of Annemette. Nik, the romantic. A good sign

550
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,450
for sure.

551
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:41,970
True to his word of protecting Annemette from
the evils of our seafaring diet, Nik asked

552
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,340
the palace kitchens to avoid the traditional
breakfast herring and traded up for summer

553
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:52,450
sausage, sweet rolls dripping in fresh butter,
and raspberries flush with dew. Served with

554
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:56,109
it is black tea, hot and fragrant.

555
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,359
My stomach growls at the mere vision of all
this food. It had been churning all morning,

556
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,670
my anxiety getting the better of me. I am
starving.

557
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:11,039
“Goodness, Evie. Do you have a tiger hidden
in your bodice?” Nik laughs into the delicate

558
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,500
china of his teacup.

559
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,499
“You know me, always smuggling wild animals
to breakfast,” I joke.

560
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:22,700
“I’d expect nothing less from your dark
magic.” Nik laughs again, and he has to

561
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,589
put the cup back into the saucer to keep from
spilling it over his shirt.

562
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:33,670
Meanwhile, Annemette can’t hide her surprise.
She stares at me, confused. After all that

563
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:39,040
fuss I made about how we must keep our magic
a secret here, the crown prince, of all people,

564
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,519
is laughing over it.

565
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:47,680
“Nik should know better than to spread dangerous
rumors like that.” I gently elbow him. This

566
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,469
is a game we play, Nik and I. Joking about
the “magic” in my family—even if his

567
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:57,869
joke is closer to the truth than he knows.
“My tante, Hansa—”

568
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:04,499
“She turns men to toads and makes a soup
out of them,” Nik says, brows shooting dramatically

569
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:10,839
under his hair. Annemette laughs, which only
encourages him. “It’s a great bit of luck

570
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:13,299
you didn’t have her pea soup last night.”

571
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:15,869
Annemette’s lips drop open.

572
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:20,349
“It’s green for a reason.” I wink at
her.

573
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:26,079
Nik and I burst into a fit of laughter, and
it feels good to relax. His fingers scramble

574
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,710
to touch the bare skin at her wrist. Maybe
this will work.

575
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:37,460
“We kid, Mette,” Nik goes on. “Tante
Hansa is a marvel of a medicine woman—she’s

576
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:42,849
saved my father a few times when our own doctor
failed, and I’ll never forget it. She’ll

577
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:47,819
take great care of your chaperone—but she
can’t turn men into toads.” Annemette

578
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:54,130
nods, a quizzical grin pulling up against
her pink cheeks. Nik lowers his voice, conspiracy

579
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:58,780
thick in his tone as he turns his back on
me. “Though I wouldn’t put it past the

580
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:05,190
old bat to have curbed my cousin’s playboy
ways so that he might fall for her niece.”

581
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:11,109
I elbow him again, this time quite hard, and
both he and Annemette laugh. “If she has

582
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:17,700
that magic, it’s certainly gone awry, considering
he didn’t come for the festival,” I say.

583
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,999
“Surely that’s Iker’s mistake,” Nik
says, snagging a sweet roll.

584
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:25,089
“I don’t make mistakes, Cousin.”

585
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:32,869
We glance up. Iker is standing in the threshold,
his back propped casually against the doorframe.

586
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:39,059
His skin is tan from days spent on deck in
the high sun, making his hair seem more bleached

587
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,480
than usual. He absentmindedly rubs at the
scruff blurring the cut of his strong jaw,

588
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,550
something I’m sure Queen Charlotte will
insist he shave. I hope he declines.

589
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:55,650
My heart is beating in my throat as he looks
over at me and our eyes meet. He grins.

590
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:04,140
Don’t smile. Don’t get up. He promised
he’d return days ago. Stay strong.

591
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:12,609
I cave. A small smile creeps up on my lips
and, in turn, his grin blooms larger. He strides

592
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,220
over, and suddenly I’m afraid he’s going
to kiss me right there in front of everyone.

593
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:24,109
In front of Nik. He pauses before me and bends
down, his fingers grazing my chin as his face

594
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:25,579
moves closer to mine.

595
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:27,200
Please don’t.

596
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,289
Gods, I wish he would.

597
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:36,859
His lips land softly on my forehead. I breathe
out a sigh, whether it’s relief or disappointment,

598
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:38,770
I don’t know.

599
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:45,390
“Hello, Evelyn,” he says, standing upright
again. “I’m sorry I’m late.”

600
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:50,289
Before I can say anything, he strides over
to Nik, stealing the sweet roll straight out

601
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:56,559
of his fingertips. “Hello, Cousin. Glad
to see you’re looking so well,” he says,

602
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,180
then takes a bite of the roll.

603
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,130
Nik stands, and the two embrace. “Mother
has been in a royal tizzy over your tardiness—I

604
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,800
hope you found that king whale you were looking
for.”

605
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,969
“I wish,” Iker replies, frustration echoing
in his voice. It’s unlike him not to get

606
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:19,680
what he wants. “We chased him past the tip
of the Jutland, but he’s a slippery bastard.”

607
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,200
“I suppose that’s why he’s named ‘king,’
Cousin.”

608
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,760
Iker grins and claps Nik on the shoulder.
“We are a slippery lot, aren’t we? Always

609
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,300
running to and from the call of duty.”

610
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,239
“And you are forever running late in both
directions.”

611
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,390
“Nothing that can’t be fixed with a grand
entrance and a daring story.”

612
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:45,229
I raise a brow. “That certainly is your
life’s motto.” The words come out harder

613
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:48,690
than I’d planned, and his smile stiffens
in answer.

614
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,900
“I’d say it’s worked well for me so
far.”

615
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:58,109
“You would,” Nik says. He’s now standing
next to Annemette’s chair, his hand grazing

616
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:04,730
her shoulder. “But let it be, Cousin. I’d
like you to meet Friherrinde Annemette.”

617
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,690
Annemette stands and steps toward Iker. She
holds out her hand like she’s done this

618
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:15,400
hundreds of times before. He takes her fingers
in his and kisses them. “Lovely to meet

619
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,480
you, Annemette. I daresay I would’ve remembered
such a gorgeous girl from my travels in the

620
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,349
Øresund. Tell me, where did you wash up from?”

621
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:32,109
My heart in my throat, I meet Annemette’s
eyes. He’s just being kind, I know he is,

622
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:33,930
but still.

623
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:39,529
“Odense,” she says, clearly comfortable
despite my heart flaring out my nostrils.

624
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:45,039
“Evie and I met yesterday, and she agreed
to show me around. Nik was game enough to

625
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:46,069
join us.”

626
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:53,549
“Who wouldn’t be?” he replies. “I’d
say yes in an instant.” Iker smiles at her,

627
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:59,479
but there’s suspicion in his eyes. It’s
just a flash, but it’s there—he doesn’t

628
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:05,099
even try to hide it. Nik and I both notice
it before his cultivated manners return and

629
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:10,719
he bows at Annemette. “I’ve traveled everywhere,
and there are no two prettier girls in all

630
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,969
the world than on this balcony.”

631
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:19,609
Both Annemette and I immediately flush scarlet,
the compliment the perfect Iker level of grandness.

632
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:26,619
And, when I glance over, Nik is fiercely blushing
too—his eyes have never left Annemette.

633
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:30,329
Iker’s attention spins across the three
of us.

634
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:32,089
“What?” I ask.

635
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:36,920
Then he shakes his head. “The lot of you
won’t survive your youth if you don’t

636
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,400
learn to take a compliment or ask for what
you want.”

637
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,960
Iker turns to Nik. “Cousin, clearly you
can’t keep your eyes off the girl. Why don’t

638
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,039
you ask the fine friherrinde to accompany
you as you explore today’s festivities?

639
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,990
I’m sure there is plenty to learn about
her.”

640
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:00,999
Annemette turns to him, a lock of blond hair
twisted around her finger. Nik lets out a

641
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,220
nervous laugh.

642
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,779
Iker, not paying attention, goes on. “While
you’re doing that, Evie and I can walk through

643
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:08,779
the gardens.”

644
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:13,430
“Really?” I say. “Don’t you think
you should ask me first?”

645
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:17,989
“Forgive me, Evelyn. Would you do me the
honor?”

646
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:24,269
I should say no. After all, what is the point?
In a day’s time, he’ll be dancing with

647
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:29,829
half the komtesses invited to the ball, one
of whom will surely become his bride. But

648
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:35,980
I can’t help wanting what I want. I look
up at Annemette, whose eyes are urging me

649
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:43,869
to go. She needs this time too. Two magical
creatures and two princes. I want to laugh.

650
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:48,410
Maybe it’s time I stopped accepting what
all of Havnestad has deemed appropriate for

651
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,130
a girl like me and started acting like the
girl they already think I am.

652
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:58,779
“It would be my pleasure, Iker,” I say,
getting up from my chair.

653
00:54:58,779 --> 00:55:05,710
Nik suddenly stands, looking very uncomfortable,
ears turning red too. “Iker, I don’t think

654
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,480
that’s a very good idea.”

655
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,969
Iker’s eyes brighten and then drop into
the same suspicious glance he gave Annemette.

656
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:17,430
He reads his cousin’s face and posture,
clearly trying to discern if this is about

657
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:23,910
him being alone with me or about Nik being
alone with Annemette or something else altogether.

658
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:30,079
His words from the ship ring in my ears: I
don’t like to step on my cousin’s toes.

659
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,310
“I’m not going to defile the girl, cousin,
we’re just going to have a kiss and catch

660
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:41,450
up.” Nik practically scoffs, but Iker just
smiles. “Nothing we haven’t done before.”

661
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:47,759
Nik’s eyes shoot to mine, and I know he
knows. It doesn’t take much for him to picture

662
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:53,489
all of it—to picture me kissing Iker like
all the other girls he leaves in his wake.

663
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:59,609
I glance down—I wish it wasn’t like this.
I just can’t take Nik looking so hurt.

664
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:04,910
Iker makes it a point to raise his brows at
Annemette, everything in the move suggesting

665
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:12,029
Nik take his girl and be fine with it. A hope
I have as well. The girl only has three days.

666
00:56:12,029 --> 00:56:17,749
Iker’s arm slinks from my waist and hooks
about my elbow. He leads me toward the door.

667
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:24,170
“Follow my lead, Cousin, but don’t follow
my footsteps.”

668
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:28,349
The late morning light is blinding when we
step out of the shadow of the castle and into

669
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:33,960
the queen’s tulip garden. We blink ourselves
down the stone path, stumbling a bit until

670
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,670
our eyes adjust, arms and legs momentarily
touching—whether by accident or on purpose,

671
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,859
only Urda knows.

672
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:47,369
It’s sinking in. Iker is here.

673
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:51,989
He came back. And he immediately wanted to
be with me.

674
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:56,700
All the disappointment and fears about what
was keeping him seem to drain from my body.

675
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:03,229
I try to push thoughts of Annemette to the
side, too. Not everyone is your responsibility,

676
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:09,519
Evie—Tante Hansa has told me this a thousand
times. Annemette is alone with her prince,

677
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,109
and I’m with mine.

678
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:17,970
After years of daydreams, my childhood fantasy
is somehow now my reality: holding hands in

679
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:24,729
a garden with Iker. Despite my status. Despite
his. Despite the lives that are meant for

680
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:31,220
us. A flash of heat runs up my neck, and my
cheeks flush with embarrassment. Iker can

681
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,380
never know how often I’ve thought of this.

682
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:41,779
But is this real? Am I stuck in dream? Or
have I lost my mind completely, and Annemette

683
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:46,119
is a figment of my imagination? Iker, too?

684
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:49,999
I wouldn’t think him real at all if his
arm weren’t still slung about my waist,

685
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:56,309
drawing me toward him, the two of us walking
toward a stone bench beneath a shady oak.

686
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:58,329
Stop questioning, Evie.

687
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:01,579
Enjoy the spell while it lasts.

688
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:07,430
He smells of the sea. Of escape. And I want
to be there with him, watching his skin go

689
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:13,779
pink and then brown, whales in our sights
and free wind in our hair. He turns to me,

690
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:20,400
both hands about my waist now, face angled
down toward mine. A smile curves at his lips

691
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,980
as he reads my eyes.

692
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:28,959
“You were worried I wouldn’t come,”
he says, and brushes a curl from my cheek.

693
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,709
I don’t deny it.

694
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:37,260
“I ran into a problem of sorts,” he says,
eyes in the middle distance, voice softening.

695
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:44,940
“I lost one of my men. The sea snatched
him overboard in broad daylight after we docked

696
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,420
in Kalø. Spent the rest of the day and much
of the next searching.”

697
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:57,550
My breath catches. It’s awful, though not
unexpected on a whaling expedition. The resolute

698
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:04,970
set to Iker’s jaw mirrors that—disappointment
but also acceptance. But then his gaze brightens

699
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:11,040
and he goes on. “Eventually, we found him,
floating unconscious between two rocks. Can

700
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:17,381
you believe it? Barely breathing and beaten
up, but alive. It was so strange, finding

701
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:20,119
something you doubted could be possible.”

702
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:25,469
A teasing note then enters his voice. “Just
like you shouldn’t have doubted me.”

703
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:30,039
“I didn’t doubt you. I doubted my expectations.”

704
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:36,099
Iker raises a brow and his eyes are on my
mouth. “And what were your expectations?”

705
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:40,089
“That you wanted to be here as much as I
wanted you to be here.”

706
00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:46,410
At this, he draws me in until his chest touches
my bodice and I can feel his legs through

707
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,539
the layers of my dress.

708
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:50,459
“Don’t doubt this.”

709
00:59:50,459 --> 00:59:56,559
He presses his mouth to mine, stealing my
breath. He is gentle in that first moment,

710
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,559
but then sweeps us down onto the bench.

711
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:04,930
The scent of salt and limes swirls about me
as my heart begins to pound hard enough that

712
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,309
I’m sure he can feel it through my bodice
and his shirt.

713
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:14,109
His hands move to my face, thumbs sweeping
the curve of my jaw. He holds me there for

714
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:16,700
a second before gently pulling away.

715
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,549
“Proof enough, Evelyn.”

716
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:25,059
He says it as a statement, not a question,
a sly little grin returning.

717
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:31,920
I purse my lips in thought. “Honestly, I’m
not sure I’ve had a large enough sampling

718
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,220
to be certain.”

719
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:38,119
Iker’s face breaks that sly little grin
into something toothy and wolfish.

720
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:43,950
“I’m free for sampling all afternoon.
Nothing princely planned until supper.”

721
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:51,029
He forces his features into serious composure.
“Will that be enough time, my lady?”

722
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:59,400
I lean in and dust a quick kiss onto his lips.
“It’s certainly a start.”

723
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,089
FOUR YEARS BEFORE

724
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:07,900
The visitor stood on the dock, parents fussing
behind him, weary from travel, though the

725
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:13,319
journey hadn’t been far. Just across the
Øresund Strait—a trip he could make with

726
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,809
his eyes shut and in his own boat, if given
the chance.

727
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:22,680
And he was planning to take that chance within
the year, permission or not.

728
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,799
The day was clear, sun beating down, drying
the wooden planks of the dock faster than

729
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:33,579
the sea could make its mark, the waves angry
the entire way from Rigeby Bay.

730
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:38,470
Footmen filed down from the castle, whisking
away the visitor’s parents, trunks, and

731
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:44,549
duties, leaving him alone with the beach and
his thoughts. At fourteen, those thoughts

732
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:46,969
were mostly of girls.

733
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,190
Brunettes.

734
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,410
Blondes.

735
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,630
Redheads.

736
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:55,579
All of them swirling in his head despite what
he knew to be true about his station—his

737
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:58,459
mother and her metaphors constantly in his
ear.

738
01:01:58,459 --> 01:02:04,119
“Tulips wilt no matter their beauty; jewels
of the crown shine forever.”

739
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:06,680
“Blood lasts longer than a whim.”

740
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,709
“The royal vase has room for but one flower,
no matter the harvest.”

741
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:16,960
His feet led him to the sand, eyes snagging
on two girls prancing along the beach, slim

742
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,619
forms moving in time with a song that barely
reached his ears.

743
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:27,069
A few yards more and the girls stopped, eyes
and fingers pointed toward a sandbar, belly

744
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:33,019
up in the swirling waters. That’s when he
recognized them—two girls from the village,

745
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:37,200
best friends always up for an adventure, just
like he was, though he got the feeling the

746
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:43,780
blonde was rather difficult to impress. Trailing
behind them was a boy, his cousin. Another

747
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,780
prince.

748
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:50,080
Then the girls began to remove their dresses,
petticoats suddenly catching the sun’s rays

749
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,799
in all their angelic white.

750
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,089
He couldn’t look away.

751
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:59,700
Not when they folded their dresses and laid
them on the sand. Not when they sprinted into

752
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,619
the waves. Not when he realized the current
was as strong as it’d been in the strait,

753
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:09,619
though he was too distracted by daydreams
of their petticoats to warn them.

754
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:14,249
It was only moments later, when the prince
dove in behind them, that the visitor was

755
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:15,479
rudely awakened.

756
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:23,329
The visitor’s feet told him to run. To help.
Neither girl had surfaced—it had been too

757
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:29,480
long. He took five steps and halted. His father
in his ear this time, another Øldenburg ruler

758
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,559
in a land full of them.

759
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:36,779
“Do not be a hero, Iker; you are already
a prince.”

760
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:42,009
His own kingdom needed him alive. If something
were to happen to him, the future of his home

761
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:48,650
and his family would be in danger. Yet still,
another voice, his own, knocked around in

762
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:49,829
his ears.

763
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:52,289
“But Nik . . .”

764
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:57,420
His cousin had grown tall of late, at least
six feet already, but he’d seen tulips thicker

765
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,930
than his arms, harpoons wider than his legs.
The visitor was the same height but built

766
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:08,539
with all the vigor of the Vikings. He was
strong. He could help.

767
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:14,450
Still, he stayed rooted to the spot. Holding
his breath as his cousin finally surfaced,

768
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:22,289
a black-haired rag doll drooping in his arms.
Strong and steady, Nik swam for the beach.

769
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:26,900
As the two landed in the sand, the visitor
breathed again, watching in awe as the boy

770
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,260
of twelve did all the right things to expel
water from her lungs. Citizens gathered around

771
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:37,459
their prince now, Lithasblot preparations
halted, all of them getting a good look at

772
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:42,650
the latest near tragedy in a history full
of them, the sea well fed in the whale-wild

773
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,930
Øresund Strait.

774
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:49,319
All the relief he’d felt fled the second
his cousin began barking orders to the men

775
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:55,319
standing around, their inaction frustrating
him. The men finally dove into the water,

776
01:04:55,319 --> 01:05:04,059
but Iker knew his cousin. Knew his heart.
Knew what he would do. He was going back too.

777
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:10,099
These girls had been a part of him for years,
one the left arm, one the right. They were

778
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:15,700
both beauties—even Nik had admitted it during
his last visit. The raven-haired girl was

779
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,710
more his cousin’s style, but the visitor
knew the blonde was the one who saw Nik in

780
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,710
that way—it was obvious.

781
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:28,089
The visitor watched the prince dive back into
the waves, and then he ran, all the strength

782
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:32,579
of his Viking blood carrying him as he tore
across the sand.

783
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:37,530
He yelled at the men swimming back to shore
empty-handed, soggy from their attempts at

784
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:42,940
finding the girl. “You there, men, don’t
leave your crown prince to do the dirty work

785
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:48,810
alone. Back in the water with you—your hope
does not fade until Prince Niklas’s does.”

786
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:55,000
Immediately, the men turned for the waves,
diving in, hope the last thing set in their

787
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,749
features. Every cut of jaw locked with the
knowledge that this was just how things went

788
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:04,759
in the Øresund Kingdoms. The sea took as
much as she gave.

789
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:11,880
But he wanted them there in case Nik faltered.
These men were insurance for the prince. Their

790
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,509
shared family could not suffer this blow,
no matter how heroic.

791
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:22,749
“Evelyn, are you all right?” He crashed
to her side, palms cupping her elegant shoulders.

792
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:27,910
“Iker?” She blinked at him as if he were
a ghost, those midnight eyes of hers dark

793
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,529
with terror. “Anna. Nik—”

794
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:35,920
“I know,” he said in his best prince voice,
the one he’d been perfecting in front of

795
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,489
the looking glass when stranded in the castle,
his heart yearning for the sea.

796
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:48,089
Iker turned back to Evelyn. Tears welled in
her eyes, gratitude in the curve of her lips.

797
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:52,700
He knew enough about the girl to know how
she felt about him, how she wanted to kiss

798
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:58,520
him right there. He knew enough about her
class—the fishermen, the worker bees—to

799
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,349
know that she wouldn’t.

800
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:05,819
Instead, her fingers tightened on his forearm
as if she were still fodder for the undertow

801
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:07,940
and he’d rescued her himself.

802
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,030
“It’d kill me to lose either of them.”

803
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:16,450
She glanced down at her hands as if the answer
were there, hidden in the web of lines—heart,

804
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,540
life, and fate.

805
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:25,170
“There is so much I wish I could do,”
she said, her voice still so weak.

806
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:32,420
That was it. There was so much he could do.
Nik was his cousin, true, but he had always

807
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:38,359
felt like a brother. And no matter the correct
name for their relationship, he was family.

808
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:40,690
And family did what had to be done.

809
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:46,859
Iker squeezed Evelyn’s shoulders for the
barest of moments, and then he was gone, yanking

810
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:51,430
off his boots as he ran toward the foaming
undertow.

811
01:07:51,430 --> 01:08:01,569
15
“OH, EVIE, IT WAS WONDERFUL,” ANNEMETTE

812
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:06,750
SAYS after half falling into the window seat
in our room. Her blond waves are as wild as

813
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:12,380
the tide in a storm, spilling at all angles
around her shoulders. The cream of her face

814
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,550
is flushed with pure joy, deep-blue eyes sparkling.

815
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:21,770
I’m so happy to see her like this. Iker
and I spent the afternoon swirled together

816
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:27,560
in a rush of touches and sweet words, two
pebbles in a whirlpool, and I can only hope

817
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,500
that she and Nik did as well.

818
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:34,420
“Nik is wonderful,” I confirm, but she
grabs my hand.

819
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:40,790
“More wonderful than I could have ever dreamed,
but so are you. There is no way I would have

820
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:47,640
had the day I just had without you.” Her
eyes swell, the skin there growing pink.

821
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,890
I squeeze her fingers. “It’s nothing,”
I say, though I can’t imagine the last few

822
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:57,830
hours with Iker would’ve happened without
her either. I can’t picture him arriving

823
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:02,410
at the castle and then hiking into its shadow
to find me in the tiny house at the end of

824
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:07,930
the lane. It’s difficult to imagine grand
Iker confined by a home smaller than this

825
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:13,460
entire palace bedroom—even when he’s on
his little schooner, his personality still

826
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,870
has room to burst into the open air of the
sea.

827
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:22,310
“Do you think he’s falling in love?”
I ask as I change dresses for tonight’s

828
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,500
Lithasblot festivities.

829
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:30,900
“I think so,” she says. “I hope. More
time would help.” She smiles weakly.

830
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:36,020
“The sooner we get going, the more you’ll
have. Almost ready?”

831
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:41,990
She fastens up the last few pearl buttons
on her pink silk gown. “Almost,” she says

832
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:47,830
and then looks at my worn navy dress. “Is
that what you’re wearing?”

833
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:53,680
I nod. I could probably conjure up a range
of dresses too if I put my mind to it, but

834
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,620
that would really send the town chirping.
Everyone knows what’s in my wardrobe.

835
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:05,280
“No, no. Wear this,” she insists, and
hands me a deep purple gown embroidered with

836
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,810
golden tulips. “I made it for you. Iker
will love it.”

837
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:18,070
I take the dress, running the lush silk between
my fingers. “Thank you,” I say. “It’s

838
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:24,561
beautiful, but I couldn’t. Can you imagine
everyone’s faces? Me in this? What will

839
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:26,290
the townspeople say?”

840
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:32,520
“Maybe something nice, for once,” Annemette
replies with a smirk.

841
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:39,040
I know she’s wrong, but I can barely take
my eyes off the dress. It’s stunning, the

842
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:44,760
workmanship so intricate, it truly could only
have been achieved with a spell. And then

843
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,420
it hits me. We have magic. “Annemette . . .”

844
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:54,170
“Yes?” she says, weaving her golden strands
into an ornate bun.

845
01:10:54,170 --> 01:11:01,100
“Can’t you use your magic . . . on Nik?
I mean, only if things don’t go as planned.

846
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:07,600
He can love you; I can see it. It’s just
. . . three days—now almost two—there’s

847
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,360
no t—”

848
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,110
“No,” she says, sticking the last pin
in her hair. “It has to be real when the

849
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:20,540
clock strikes midnight after the ball. That’s
it. Magic can masquerade as love, but none

850
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:27,540
has ever satisfied Urda before. These little
things, dresses and such, are as far as I’ll

851
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:34,890
go. He has to love me as me. No tricks. Promise
me you won’t do anything to interfere, Evie.”

852
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:41,730
I nod, my lips closed tight. Of course she’s
right. I don’t want to manipulate Nik’s

853
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:46,210
feelings either, but the consequences are
just so steep.

854
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:52,950
I step into her gown, the cool fabric sliding
over my skin, its shape fitting me perfectly.

855
01:11:52,950 --> 01:12:00,310
I barely recognize myself as I stare in the
mirror, looking so much like one of the nobles.

856
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,670
Perhaps a costume is all I ever needed.

857
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:08,620
“You look like a princess,” Annemette
says, giving me a kiss on the cheek. “Let’s

858
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,860
go. Our princes await.”

859
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:18,170
I grab her hand, and we walk down through
the palace and out the gates. This night,

860
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:25,560
the third night, is what everyone always mentions
when Lithasblot comes up. When it is perfectly

861
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:31,600
normal, possibly even a compliment, to toss
a slice of rye or a dense roll at your neighbor.

862
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:37,121
Predictably, Malvina Christensen lives for
this night. It gives her a chance to show

863
01:12:37,121 --> 01:12:43,350
off, and gods know she would never shy away
from that. Not one for needlepoint or whatever

864
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:48,830
komtesses are supposed to learn, Malvina chose
to take up baking instead, always underfoot

865
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:55,660
of her cook as a girl. I’ll admit, she became
rather good, that blue monstrosity aside,

866
01:12:55,660 --> 01:13:00,900
though I’ll take partial responsibility
for its demise. She’s eager to tell anyone

867
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:07,030
questioning her that baking is a hobby, even
though it’s beneath her, an activity more

868
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:12,720
befitting someone like me. “If you feed
a man right, he’ll be true to you for life,”

869
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:19,490
I’ve heard her say many times. It’s strange,
she so wants me out of her way, too crude

870
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:25,330
for her class, and yet here she is parading
her lowbrow achievements. I guess when you

871
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:28,890
have power, you can be whoever you want.

872
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:33,870
Though the sun has yet to set and the townspeople
are still wandering the offering tables in

873
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:39,670
search of their suppers, Malvina has snagged
herself a prominent spot by the bonfire. Around

874
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:46,480
her is a literal sea of treats—petits fours,
scones à la Brighton, out-of-season fried

875
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,770
aebleskiver, and crusty rolls of rye and soft
rolls of sweet Russian wheat, both in the

876
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:58,900
shape of the sun wheel. There’s a massive
blueberry pie as well, juices glistening from

877
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,220
under a golden lattice crust.

878
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:06,830
“Malvina, my, you’ve outdone yourself
yet again,” Nik says with a royal smile

879
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,920
as we come upon her.

880
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:14,330
The girl beams at him. “Why thank you, Nik.
It would be an honor if you enjoyed something

881
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,330
before the throwing begins.”

882
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,220
Nik waves her off. “That’s not—”

883
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:25,360
“I insist. Please take something, there
is more than enough here for Urda.”

884
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,440
Training and practice with Malvina’s forcibly
charitable nature are enough to keep Nik from

885
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:35,270
fighting her one word more. “If that is
the case, then yes. Something small would

886
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,540
be greatly appreciated.”

887
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:43,530
Her still-beaming smile grows larger as she
dips to the blanket and chooses a petit four,

888
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:49,200
done in perfect French style. “There’s
plenty for your friends, too,” she adds

889
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,100
as an afterthought.

890
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:58,270
I’m shocked. Malvina has never offered me
anything, and then I realize, she may not

891
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:04,500
recognize me. It’s the dress. It must be
sewn with the most powerful sorcery to deceive

892
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,330
a shark like Malvina.

893
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:12,880
“How kind of you,” I say, taking a scone
and watching her pewter eyes for recognition.

894
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,670
And then there it is, a slight snarl.

895
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:23,070
“Oh, Evie,” she says. “My, that’s
quite a dress. Where did you—”

896
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:30,820
“It was a gift. From me, Friherrinde Annemette,”
Mette interrupts while plucking a sweet roll.

897
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:36,800
“For being a good friend and the most gracious
host.” And then she does the unthinkable—she

898
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:43,400
links her arms right through mine and Nik’s,
pulling us close on either side.

899
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:50,290
Malvina smiles so tightly I can see the veins
in her neck. “Well, from a komtesse to a

900
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:55,120
friherrinde, a word of advice. If you treat
your help to such finery, they’ll get used

901
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,120
to it.”

902
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:02,800
“I hope so,” says Annemette. “I have
plenty more where that came from. Thank you

903
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,850
for the sweets.”

904
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:12,400
And then we walk away. Just like that. Nik
seems a little stunned, ever the proper prince,

905
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,350
but even he can’t help but laugh. “You
really do look lovely, Evie.”

906
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,460
“Seconded,” Iker says, grabbing my hand.

907
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:25,600
I thank them both for probably the third time
that night, and then we walk the boys to the

908
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,640
platform for tonight’s celebration of the
grain crop. Annemette and I take our seats

909
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,030
in the little white wooden chairs reserved
for the nobility—another new view for me,

910
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:43,860
having only sat on the sand before. As the
sky darkens, Nik begins to speak, but I can’t

911
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:50,820
focus, my mind on so many things. The Lithasblot
festival was always something I knew so well,

912
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,810
every year the same, and for a time, I didn’t
go at all.

913
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:01,800
The Lithasblot after Anna drowned, I never
left the house. Nik, Tante Hansa, and Father

914
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,810
all tried to draw me from my bed, sure that
a measure of festival fun would go a long

915
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:09,040
way toward cheering me up.

916
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:15,640
But song and dance cannot close a wound like
that. More like it pours salt on it—watching

917
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:21,710
other people sing and dance like nothing had
happened, all the while blistered with grief.

918
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:25,370
I didn’t go. Not that year nor the next.

919
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:30,760
I’d tried to spend the time reading Tante
Hansa’s spell books—the only thing that’d

920
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:36,370
kept me sane in those days—but even that
took too much effort. All the strength I had

921
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,890
went to shutting out laughter and song.

922
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,620
It was only last year that I agreed to go
with Nik again.

923
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:47,830
He’d lost his friend too but had to make
a show of being at the festival immediately—the

924
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:53,140
day of her death—duty and title forcing
him to walk around in his nice clothes and

925
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:58,250
accept the people’s offerings to Urda. He
didn’t have to speak as he does yet again

926
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:03,890
tonight, but it was still painful enough just
to stand up in front of everyone while so

927
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:04,890
broken.

928
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:11,620
We are far from that now—not healed, of
course, but with just two days left, this

929
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:16,920
festival has felt like the last one we attended
when Anna was alive. Iker came that year,

930
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:22,830
arriving with his parents from Rigeby Bay,
fourteen and suddenly very tall. Anna and

931
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:27,980
I mooned over him every night, whispering
about his eyes and laughing while huddled

932
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:33,660
up in her mansion bedroom. It would be a year
before she told me that she actually preferred

933
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:40,660
Nik to Iker and my mind filled of dreams of
us as twin queens, the friherrinde-to-princess

934
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:47,470
and the pauper-to-princess loves of Øldenburg
kings on both sides of the Øresund Strait.

935
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:53,930
Of course, Annemette is not Anna, but I can’t
shake the feeling that this is what we could

936
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:58,780
have had. I glance over at Annemette as she
watches Nik speak on the platform in front

937
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:04,340
of the bonfire. Rosebud lips slightly parted,
she follows his words with the precision of

938
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:10,650
a predator, so intent on remembering everything
he says. I never saw Anna look at Nik like

939
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:15,860
Annemette does, but eleven-year-old girls
can hide their feelings as much as any of

940
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:16,860
us.

941
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:22,410
Suddenly, Annemette’s lips pull up in a
smile, eyes sharpening to something hard,

942
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:28,850
and I follow her gaze up to Nik. He’s watching
her back, but then looks to me, doing his

943
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:35,490
best to concentrate on the words. Still, his
ears begin to blush. Then Iker hands Nik the

944
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:42,010
ceremonial first loaf of bread—large as
a cannonball, crafted of dark rye, and braided

945
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:46,100
in the shape of the sun wheel. Nik holds the
loaf above his head.

946
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:53,220
“And so, let us give thanks to Urda with
the staff of life—bread. Let us share our

947
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:58,640
gifts of grain with our neighbors. Let no
person in need go without. Let the loaves

948
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:05,910
fly to them with the gentlest of care, a blessing
from Urda by way of a neighbor’s hand.”

949
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:10,250
Nik tears a hunk of bread off the loaf and
hands it to King Asger. Another piece goes

950
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:16,560
to Queen Charlotte, and a third to Iker, whose
parents stayed home this year. Together, the

951
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,580
royal family lines up in front of the fire,
bread in hand.

952
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,940
Nik lifts his piece above his crowned head.

953
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:27,500
“Let the sharing begin.”

954
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,690
With that, all four of them toss the bread
in the direction of the crowd. Nik’s lands

955
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:37,761
gently in Annemette’s lap. She laughs, and
I’m so busy laughing too that I’m not

956
01:20:37,761 --> 01:20:42,960
paying attention when a crusty hunk of rye
thwacks me square in the chest, bouncing off

957
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:49,161
my bodice and into my lap. I glance up and
see Iker with a vicious grin, hovering over

958
01:20:49,161 --> 01:20:52,030
the royal table, snatching more.

959
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:56,820
I grab a loaf from the table next to me and
stand. I rip it in half and give the remainder

960
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,700
to Annemette. “Aim for Iker.”

961
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:06,320
Her brows pull together with a moment of confusion.
“I thought the bread was for the less fortunate?”

962
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:13,150
I gesture toward the sky. “It’s raining
bread. No one will go hungry, I promise.”

963
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:18,060
Annemette looks up to see that, yes, bread
of every make and shape is flying through

964
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:23,960
the air. She ducks as a sweet roll screams
in from Malvina’s direction. It bounces

965
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,980
off Fru Ulla with a honeyed thud before a
toddler snags it with two chubby hands.

966
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:34,940
“It’s all in good fun,” I assure her,
and chuck the bread Iker’s way. He puts

967
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:39,940
his arms up to shield his face but drops them
too quickly and gets clobbered right in the

968
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,780
nose by Annemette’s piece.

969
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:48,210
This only serves to make him grin and seize
two cherry tarts from the table. He thrusts

970
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:52,940
one into Nik’s hands, and they advance on
us, eyes glinting.

971
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:57,540
“Run!” I screech, and grab Annemette’s
hand.

972
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:03,270
We snake through the crowd and onto an open
stretch of beach. Twined together, we run

973
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:09,140
along the shoreline. But the boys are faster,
and tarts whack us each in the back. We fall

974
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:14,140
to the sand in hysterics—something I haven’t
done in four years.

975
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:19,480
The boys pull us up—Iker hooking one arm
under my knees and the other at my shoulders.

976
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:24,450
He runs a finger along my back until my once
class-defying gown is slick with beach-ruined

977
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:29,960
cherry filling and aims it toward my mouth.
“Sandy tart for the lady.”

978
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,400
I seal my lips and shake my head.

979
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,230
“For Urda, you must.”

980
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:40,610
The absurdity of the look on his face pulls
my lips apart, and he seizes his opportunity

981
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:46,270
to drop the filling onto my tongue. I gag
and buck, coughing with laughter, and tumble

982
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:48,240
out of his arms and into the sand.

983
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:54,970
Iker goes down too, landing beside me. His
eyes seem to glow as he leans over my body

984
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:01,890
and lowers his lips to mine. I enjoy the kiss,
his newly shaven skin baby soft against my

985
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:09,460
chin. I guess Iker doesn’t defy all royal
protocols; Queen Charlotte won this round.

986
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:15,041
“Mmmm,” he says, licking cherry filling
from his lips. “Delicious, though a bit

987
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:16,970
. . . gritty.”

988
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:20,150
I laugh. “Sandy tarts always are.”

989
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:22,830
“Odd bit of cuisine, you Havnestaders.”

990
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:28,990
“Eat up. Nik will expect you at full strength
tomorrow,” I say.

991
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:34,930
Iker raises a brow, mischief on his lips.
“What if I told him I was saving my strength

992
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:36,810
for you?”

993
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:40,960
I push him away from me and stand, my back
to him, arms crossed.

994
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:46,270
“I was kidding,” he pleads. “Are all
the games tomorrow?”

995
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:49,910
I nod, dusting myself off while he still lies
in the sand.

996
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:53,950
“Does this mean tomorrow is when you will
shimmy across a log?”

997
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:59,290
When I don’t respond, he stands and wraps
his arms around me from behind, trailing two

998
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,410
fingers across my navel, having them mimic
a stiff jog.

999
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:10,620
“As promised, my prince,” I say, laughing
a little. Why do I always give in?

1000
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:11,620
“Yes—”

1001
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:18,640
A scream cuts off Iker’s answer. Annemette.
Both Iker and I whip our heads toward Annemette

1002
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:25,140
and Nik. They are closer to the crowd, Annemette
crouching in the sand, Nik staggering a bit

1003
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:32,450
before falling to his knees, clutching his
stomach. Standing before both of them is Malvina,

1004
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:36,270
hands in front of her body as if they’d
just released a dagger.

1005
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:43,310
Iker stiffens, his whole body suddenly rigid
with tension. “Cousin?”

1006
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:49,230
Nik staggers to a stand and raises a hand
to wave him off, turning toward us. His white

1007
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:55,310
shirt and dazzling royal coat are a mess of
black, like the tears I’ve cried twice before.

1008
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:59,980
Iker takes a step toward the scene, fists
forming.

1009
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:05,660
But then Nik points toward his boots. Toward
the pie plate lying facedown in the sand.

1010
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:10,830
“Urda has been quite generous with Malvina’s
blueberry pie. The goddess must have decided

1011
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:16,980
that my wardrobe and the beach were in particular
need of nourishment.” With that, Nik begins

1012
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,010
to laugh.

1013
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:25,940
Immediately, Iker joins him, and I catch Annemette’s
eye as she rises from her crouch. A little

1014
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:31,100
chuckle bubbles from her lips, growing into
a full laugh when her attention turns to Nik’s

1015
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:36,230
doubled-over form. I’m almost too shocked
to laugh, having been holding my breath this

1016
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:38,360
whole time, but then I join in too.

1017
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:45,480
The only one not finding humor in all this
is Malvina, embarrassment but not regret in

1018
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:50,980
the set of her jaw. She doesn’t apologize
as she storms past Annemette—clearly her

1019
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:55,850
intended target—and snatches the pie plate
from the sand at Nik’s feet.

1020
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:00,991
She stands to face him. Nik attempts to compose
himself enough to look her in the eye but

1021
01:26:00,991 --> 01:26:06,750
fails miserably, laughter still wryly present
in his features as he lets the blueberry glop

1022
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:10,600
and sugar crust slide off his gold-threaded
coat and onto the beach.

1023
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:17,150
“I hope you will enjoy this gift in the
name of Urda,” Malvina announces, nose in

1024
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:24,560
the air, before pivoting on her heel as best
as she can in beach sand, blond hair flying.

1025
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:30,060
When she’s gone, we gather around him and
survey the damage. The shirt, coat and even

1026
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,500
his pants are all unsalvageable.

1027
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:39,440
But true to his nature, Nik just grins and
presents his sopping clothes.

1028
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:48,110
“Pie, ladies? Urda does insist.”

1029
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:52,370
16
I WAKE WITH THE SUN THE FOLLOWING MORNING,

1030
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:57,250
STILL warm with feelings of belonging from
the night before. Yesterday was a daydream

1031
01:26:57,250 --> 01:27:03,530
from start to end, and I wanted to never wake
up. But in the white morning light, reality

1032
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:07,650
becomes stark and my mood shifts quickly.

1033
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:13,160
Annemette is still fast asleep, toes stretching
toward the ceiling, arms thrown above her

1034
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:19,030
head, tangled within her waves. I lie there
for a moment and listen to the gulls before

1035
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:24,830
I realize my opportunity. I know a way I can
do some real good today.

1036
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:29,920
On silent feet, I head to the wardrobe and
tug it open. The first dress on the right

1037
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,930
is one I wore two days ago when I met Annemette.
I can’t believe that’s all the time that’s

1038
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:41,060
passed, but in the same breath, I can’t
believe so much of our time has vanished.

1039
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:46,280
Today and tomorrow until midnight, and then
it could all be over in the most horrific

1040
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:51,820
way possible—or it might be the happiest
ending of all.

1041
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:56,590
Annemette still seems confident, and I’m
obeying her request that I not intervene,

1042
01:27:56,590 --> 01:28:01,670
at least not magically, but the thought of
losing another friend to the sea is almost

1043
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:08,420
unbearable. First Anna, then nearly Nik, and
now Annemette, who’s only been in my life

1044
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:14,050
for a short while, but who’s helped open
my world in ways I’d never imagined. She’s

1045
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:19,740
the friend Anna never could be to me, that
Nik can’t be, either. She’s the only one

1046
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:23,570
who knows my secrets. Well, most of them.

1047
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:29,320
I’ve been pushing these feelings down, telling
myself this is her decision, that I should

1048
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:34,280
instead try to appreciate the life around
me, as I’m sure she is, but I don’t know

1049
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,670
how much longer I can feel so helpless.

1050
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:43,110
At least I can still use my magic for one
thing. I fish through my dress pocket. My

1051
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:48,070
fingers brush past the vial of ink from the
other day and curl around the little amethyst,

1052
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:52,410
safe and sound where I left it. I can only
hope that my morning away from the docks led

1053
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:58,140
to just one day of poor fishing, or maybe
none at all—the magic is new enough that

1054
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:01,240
I don’t know what happens if I don’t do
it.

1055
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:07,260
I dress quickly, and, minutes later, I make
it to the docks without seeing a soul. The

1056
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:12,440
cobblestones are littered with dew-covered
crumbs, orphaned the night before, and so

1057
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,430
far neglected by the Øresund birds.

1058
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:21,730
The docks are quiet too, no ships coming or
going, though that will change in a few hours.

1059
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:27,360
Today is the favorite among the festivalgoers.
The gluttony of the previous nights draws

1060
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,750
some, the final day of sailing and dancing
attracts others, but not nearly as many as

1061
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:37,610
those lining up to participate or watch the
games today.

1062
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:42,320
Our games aren’t exactly as sophisticated
as the ancient Olympics Fru Seraphine taught

1063
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:47,170
us about in school, but they are more than
enough for the people of Havnestad.

1064
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:53,420
Palm out and full, I close my eyes and run
the amethyst along the docked ship hulls one

1065
01:29:53,420 --> 01:30:00,090
by one, mumbling aloud the words that seem
to work, mostly because, with no one around,

1066
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,050
I don’t have to say them in my head.

1067
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:08,500
“Knorr yfir haf, knorr yfir haf, sigla tryggr,
fanga þrír.

1068
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:14,960
Knorr yfir haf, knorr yfir haf, sigla tryggr,
fanga þrír.”

1069
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:23,870
The words hit my ear as childish, so much
more sophisticated when spoken only in the

1070
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:28,970
space of my mind. I suddenly wish I’d trusted
my magic enough to create a simple and strong

1071
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:34,620
Old Norse command—like something Annemette
would do. I’d do it now but I’m afraid

1072
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,820
of what the change will bring.

1073
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:40,080
My words are like a nursery rhyme—but they
will do.

1074
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,940
When I’m finished with every ship in port,
I stand on the edge of the royal dock—the

1075
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,540
longest pier in Havnestad Harbor—and face
the strait.

1076
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:58,220
“Urda, if you will, bring my words to Father,
wherever in the Øresund he may be. Keep him

1077
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:04,630
safe; leave him to me. You do not need him.
Please don’t take him simply because you

1078
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:05,630
can.”

1079
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:10,690
Anna’s face crosses my mind, open and free
with laughter before she was taken by the

1080
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:17,340
waves. But I push it down as far as it will
go, along with my dark thoughts of the morning.

1081
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:23,540
I need to live like Annemette, like Iker,
and enjoy the day to its fullest.

1082
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,460
I turn and head back to the castle.

1083
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:31,630
I don’t see him at first, my eyes on the
clouds the sun has tinged pink with the rising

1084
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:37,170
dawn. But then I hear the soft plink of a
guitaren being strummed ever so lightly in

1085
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:41,450
the tulip garden. That song again, from the
party.

1086
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:48,170
“Nik?” His chin tilts my way, eyes swinging
away from the sea. He is on the stone bench

1087
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:54,050
under the shade tree, the wrinkled version
of his strapping statue across the garden—muslin

1088
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:59,390
nightclothes rumpled, unbrushed hair shoved
out of his eyes with his fingertips. “Did

1089
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:03,040
you come out here this morning to let the
birds clean the last bit of pie from behind

1090
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,040
your ears?”

1091
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,250
“I ran a bath last night, but thanks for
noticing.”

1092
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:13,400
“Then you must have risen early to meditate
on a plan to best Iker in the rock carry.”

1093
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:19,440
Nik raises an arm and pats his lean bicep.
“The only plan I need, my lady.”

1094
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:25,070
I punch him on the arm, and we sit quietly
for a few moments. The pink of dawn has shifted

1095
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:29,920
to salmon, the tone already rumbling toward
the golden yellow it turns just before the

1096
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:35,390
classic blue sky wins out and the sun is fully
over the horizon.

1097
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:40,380
Fingers scrabble Nik’s hair back again from
his brow, and his face turns toward the stones

1098
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:45,930
at our feet. After a breath, he raises his
eyes to mine, and I have a feeling I might

1099
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:49,240
learn the real answer to his morning meditation.

1100
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:56,950
“Evie . . . ,” he starts, and my heart
sinks at the mournful tone. Oh no. “Evie,

1101
01:32:56,950 --> 01:33:00,600
have you really kissed Iker?”

1102
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:06,410
My heart skids to a halt and I sit there,
jaw tense. I don’t know what to say. I’m

1103
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:10,420
not ready to talk about me and Iker. Not to
Nik, anyway.

1104
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:15,760
I laugh and elbow him in the ribs, hoping
a joke can mend whatever is in his voice.

1105
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,690
“The real question is, have you kissed Annemette?”

1106
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:26,260
I hope he’ll turn red. Say yes. Admit to
it so that maybe Annemette has a chance to

1107
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:30,730
stay—to live!—and fill the hole in our
hearts.

1108
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:36,240
Instead, his face squishes up as if he’s
smelled something spoiled. “Of course not.

1109
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:40,870
I’m a romantic, but I’m not a cad—I’m
not, not . . .”

1110
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:46,480
“Iker?” My voice is angrier than I intended,
but there’s something in the pit of my stomach.

1111
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:51,330
Something hot like disappointment, not only
at him for his clear disdain for Iker but

1112
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:54,250
for anything I do with him.

1113
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:59,510
He stops and starts, and I can tell he doesn’t
know where to begin. It’s rare that I ever

1114
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:05,510
get angry with him. Rare that he can’t bring
order with a princely smile or a knowing glance,

1115
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:10,200
his only tools of conflict the royal formalities
his mother has ingrained in him.

1116
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:16,460
“I realize it’s stupid,” he says finally.
“I’m sixteen and a prince to boot—I

1117
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:22,150
should be having fun. Mother would never let
something wrongheaded get so far along. She

1118
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:29,110
has plans for me, besides. It’s just . . . I
like Annemette. But it’s not . . . it’s

1119
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:35,940
not”—he looks at me, and there’s something
else in his eyes—“as it is in the storybooks.”

1120
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:42,300
Then he glances up at me, the change in his
focus clear in the set of his jaw. “And

1121
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:49,720
for him to kiss you . . .” Nik shakes his
head, his posture withering. “God, I must

1122
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:50,850
sound a mess—”

1123
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:56,440
“No,” I say, air rushing into my lungs
just enough to get the word out.

1124
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:02,440
He laughs softly under his breath. “Yes,
I do. I sound crazed.”

1125
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:08,480
“You sound confused. You can find ‘crazed’
in those lovesick books we read as children.

1126
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:14,080
Those princes who lock girls up in a tower
to get their way—those are the crazy ones.”

1127
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:21,810
Nik nods to himself. “Yes, Mette is a nice
girl, lovely really, and beautiful, and I

1128
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:26,910
regret that she’ll have to return to Odense,
but I don’t think I’ll ever love her enough

1129
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:32,160
to be . . . to be . . . her fairy-tale prince.”

1130
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:38,360
My stomach practically collapses. But Nik
is just speaking from the heart. He doesn’t

1131
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:45,180
know there is no Odense for Annemette. No
. . . nothing. She’s just another girl his

1132
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:51,310
mother has forced upon him. What if I told
him the truth? Maybe that would change things.

1133
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:57,880
Evie, what are you talking about? Tell him
she’s a mermaid? But maybe he’d see how

1134
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:04,230
wonderful she is and would want to save her,
just like he tried to save Anna. But then

1135
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:10,990
this truly would all be on his shoulders.
All that guilt. Can love spring from guilt?

1136
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:17,300
Is that true love? I don’t know . . . how
should I know what true love is? No, if I

1137
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:22,420
told him the truth, it might ruin any further
time she has to win him over. This is all

1138
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:28,090
my fault, for trouncing around with Iker while
Nik spends precious time worrying about me,

1139
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:32,720
taking his mind off Annemette. I have to try
something else.

1140
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:39,510
“She reminds me so much of Anna . . . ,” I
say, feeling as if the words are tiptoeing

1141
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,510
out.

1142
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:46,270
“Her coloring, yes,” he admits, but doesn’t
go further. Not the response I was hoping

1143
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:47,270
for.

1144
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:50,240
“And her features. Her singing voice.”

1145
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,260
He shrugs and leans back off his knees and
straightens. “But you know what’s not?

1146
01:36:55,260 --> 01:37:00,650
The way she looks at me—Anna never would’ve
allowed herself to think of me as handsome.”

1147
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:07,580
“That’s so untrue! She had a huge crush
on you, and you know it.” I knock his shoulder,

1148
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:12,720
though it feels strange to speak of Anna’s
private feelings as a joke. I’m quiet for

1149
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:19,670
a moment, and then I say, “Give Annemette
a real chance, please. For me.”

1150
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:21,470
“But what about you and Iker?”

1151
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:27,050
“Stop thinking about Iker, Nik! I’m happy,
but I won’t let him ruin me, like I know

1152
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:32,760
you’re so afraid of. I’m smarter than
that.” He blushes red for a moment, but

1153
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:40,220
I keep going. “The only happiness I want
you to worry about is yours.”

1154
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:42,760
FOUR YEARS BEFORE

1155
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,710
The boy dove back in. He couldn’t just leave
it to these other men to find his friend.

1156
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:52,530
He’d saved one; he needed to try to save
the other.

1157
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:59,070
Drowning was common in Havnestad—the sea
took as much as she gave—but this, this

1158
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,630
could not be.

1159
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:06,040
Immediately, the water clawed at the damp
length of him, the undertow a thousand hands

1160
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,420
ripping his body toward the swirling sands
below.

1161
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:15,220
His father’s constant refrain crept into
his head. Do not be a hero, Iker; you are

1162
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,970
already a prince.

1163
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:22,550
He’d said it anytime Nik had done anything
particularly reckless. A compliment swaddled

1164
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:29,620
in a reminder: You are not just a prince,
you are an heir. The lone heir.

1165
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:35,070
And here was his father’s voice, nagging
as fiercely as the waves.

1166
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:41,771
He crested the surface and shook it all off—the
words, the water—and filled his lungs. All

1167
01:38:41,771 --> 01:38:49,060
around him, men thrashed in the waves. Not
a single one held Anna.

1168
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:54,150
The boy dove down again, forcing his eyes
open against the salty sting.

1169
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:57,350
Blue. Blue everywhere.

1170
01:38:57,350 --> 01:39:00,010
He blinked, letting his vision adjust.

1171
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:06,920
Shadows on the ocean floor became crops of
seaweed, moving in dark time. Algae, debris,

1172
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,990
and the tiniest of sea horses floated across
the blue, a mosaic rather than one solidly

1173
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:14,990
flowing body.

1174
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:19,800
His eyes swung left, right. His entire body
spun around.

1175
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,820
She’s here. She’s here. She must be here.

1176
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:30,010
He surfaced again, not far from the sandbar
now. No men yelling. No one sagging under

1177
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:33,110
the weight of a blonde in a petticoat.

1178
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:39,470
Back down again, deeper, deeper, the undertow
greedily guiding him on.

1179
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:45,360
Eyes open, he scanned the bottom. Lungs burning
for breath, he dove.

1180
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,050
And there.

1181
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:54,320
One hundred yards away. Down in a crevice.
A flash of white. A foot, bare against a huge

1182
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,280
tangle of seaweed and coral.

1183
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:02,940
Eyes pinned on her location, he shot to the
surface—he’d need air to get her. Eight

1184
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,210
great, heaving breaths.

1185
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:08,490
I can do this. I can get to her.

1186
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:15,140
Down he dove again, eyes open as he plunged,
pinned to the sliver of white. So far away.

1187
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:17,010
So far down.

1188
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:24,500
The boy’s lungs burned. His ears popped.
Darkness crept into the corners of his vision.

1189
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:30,100
And still the slip of white was there. But
not getting closer. It never seemed to get

1190
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:36,760
any larger, any more attainable. It just flashed
on the seafloor, so much a star he could not

1191
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,460
touch.

1192
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:43,830
His mind began to slow, as did his legs and
arms, which no longer struggled against the

1193
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,570
undertow.

1194
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:49,780
You do not need to be a hero, Iker; you are
already a prince.

1195
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:52,450
You are not just a prince, you are an heir.

1196
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:54,920
The lone heir.

1197
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:59,010
Breath beating against his lungs, he made
his choice.

1198
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:01,690
The prince pushed himself deeper.

1199
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:06,260
His life didn’t matter more than hers. He
was the one with the chance to save her, and

1200
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,400
that chance shouldn’t hinge on the blood
in his veins.

1201
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:16,690
Legs burning, he kicked, no breath left in
his lungs to propel him. But he was so close.

1202
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:23,300
He could make out actual toes now. Head pounding
without air, blood spiked with pressure, he

1203
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:27,710
kicked again, his arms pulling against the
water.

1204
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:34,940
But then came a pressure on his foot. Yanking
him back—up. Pulling him until, for a heartbeat,

1205
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:40,050
the weight was gone. As soon as it disappeared,
it was replaced with elbows hooking under

1206
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:47,260
his shoulders. A chest at his back. And force,
so much force, propelling him to the surface.

1207
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:53,190
In that moment, his lungs finally sputtered
for breath and he involuntarily inhaled, water

1208
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:58,400
still surrounding him. A deep mouthful of
the sea hovered above his windpipe for a split

1209
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,490
second before he spit it back into the water.

1210
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:09,331
Out of breath, out of time, water closing
in, he broke the surface. The air was so fresh

1211
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:16,370
it burned; as his lungs heaved, his tongue
swelled from the salt he’d inhaled.

1212
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:21,690
Coughing, breathing—finally breathing—he
opened his eyes again, water streaming into

1213
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:23,420
his eyes.

1214
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:26,870
He couldn’t see well, but he knew the face
before him.

1215
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:34,330
“No! Iker—” he began, coughing. Coughing
so hard. More salt water streamed out of his

1216
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:41,400
mouth. Dribbled down his chin. He wiped at
his mouth with a sleeve so wet, it just smeared

1217
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,390
the water around with more water.

1218
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:49,120
“I’ve got you, Cousin. I’ve got you.
Don’t worry. You’re safe.”

1219
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:55,560
“I—” He coughed again and took a breath,
long and deep. “I have to get her.”

1220
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,820
With air in his lungs, he tried to shrug off
his cousin.

1221
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:02,660
“She’s gone, Nik. She’s gone. And you
were going to be too.”

1222
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:08,100
“No! She’s down there. I saw her. You
had to have seen her too. She’s right there,

1223
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,100
right down—”

1224
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:14,820
“Don’t be a hero, Nik.” Boat-strong
biceps pinned the prince in a hug—his arms

1225
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:19,710
stuck at his sides, his only recourse to kick,
but that just propelled them closer to the

1226
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:22,140
beach. Farther from her.

1227
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:27,820
“Iker, please. She needs us. Anna needs
us. We can rescue her. We can—”

1228
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:32,670
“We can’t.” His cousin’s newly deepened
voice cracked as he said it, and there was

1229
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:33,970
a hitch in his kick. “We can’t.”

1230
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:42,900
“We can! We can get her!” He was yelling,
even though his voice was rough and sloppy.

1231
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:48,570
His cousin only squeezed harder. His lips
came to the prince’s ear, his voice smaller

1232
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:53,840
than seemed possible. “If you die rescuing
her, it won’t give solace to your parents

1233
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,810
or your people. It will only give Havnestad
another body.”

1234
01:43:57,810 --> 01:44:06,650
“But she’s not a body. She’s not. She’s
there. Right there.” But even as he said

1235
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:13,960
the words, he knew it had been too long now.
Ten minutes, though it felt like a hundred.

1236
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:21,250
And then he started to cry. Salty tears running
down his cheeks and into the harbor. He didn’t

1237
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:30,930
wipe them. He let them run. Let them join
Anna at sea.

1238
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:36,840
17
THE ANNUAL LITHASBLOT GAMES BEGIN IN THE SWELTER

1239
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:42,970
of noon. Havnestad citizens and onlookers
from across the Øresund Strait spill onto

1240
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:47,870
the main beach, ready for games of skill and
sport to take place from the mountains above

1241
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:49,190
to the seas below.

1242
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:55,290
It’s the first time in days the boys aren’t
properly gussied up in public. To be sure,

1243
01:44:55,290 --> 01:45:00,050
they’re both clean-shaven—the easier to
show off their game faces—but they are also

1244
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:05,200
wearing simple cotton work pants and shirts
rolled at the sleeves. This change of dress

1245
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,390
is tradition too.

1246
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:13,690
Today is about demonstrating skill. I wasn’t
lying when I told Iker our games were useful—they

1247
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:20,090
were indeed born out of utility. Rock climbing
and trail running in the mountains. Log running

1248
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:25,320
in the stream that feeds into the harbor.
Swimming in the mouth of the sea. Vital to

1249
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:31,690
life, every one of them. Useful—right down
to the rock carry along the beach, which mimics

1250
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:34,530
laboring to bring cargo ashore.

1251
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:40,240
And each citizen in Havnestad has an equal
shot to compete. Be you ninety-five or still

1252
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:45,330
flush with baby fat, if you can walk, you
are allowed to have a go—with the royal

1253
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:50,040
family cheering you on, or possibly acting
as your competition.

1254
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:55,070
After plates of samsø, rye bread, and peaches,
Nik is instructed by his father to oversee

1255
01:45:55,070 --> 01:46:01,320
the mountain events first. Those sports have
the fewest competitors, and King Asger would

1256
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:04,290
much rather view the action on the beach.

1257
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:10,240
And King Asger gets what King Asger wants—even
from his son.

1258
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:15,680
True to his nature, Nik bows—no crown atop
his head—before grabbing another peach and

1259
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:20,540
a flask of water and tugging Annemette toward
Lille Bjerg Pass.

1260
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:24,230
I side-eye Iker when he doesn’t make a move
to follow.

1261
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:29,840
His strong hand gently cuffs my wrist and
pulls me close. In a breath, I’m an inch

1262
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:36,150
away from his lips. The depths of his eyes
are striking in the high sun, clear and merry

1263
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:41,390
after a good night’s rest in a real bed
and not a ship’s dank quarters. “Let’s

1264
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,810
just stay here alone.”

1265
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:50,540
I shift my eyes to the beach. “Alone—with
five thousand of our closest friends, including

1266
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:52,240
your aunt and uncle.”

1267
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:58,120
Iker laughs and gently fingers the curls that
have blown forward over my shoulder. “So

1268
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,300
many people that not a one of them is watching
. . .”

1269
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:07,880
No, they’re watching. I can feel it. He’s
just used to it.

1270
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,390
I pull away, shifting the arm he’s snagged
so I’m grabbing his wrist as he clutches

1271
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:19,570
mine. I tug him toward Lille Bjerg Pass. “There
are many side trails along the pass, thick

1272
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:20,950
with brush.”

1273
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:26,210
He raises a brow and finally takes a step
forward. “It would be a shame if we were

1274
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,210
to get lost.”

1275
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:31,110
“Such a shame. Nik would be so disappointed.”

1276
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:34,320
“Only if he’s lost in the same brush we
are.”

1277
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:40,450
It’s true. Nik returned a different person
after our early morning conversation, focusing

1278
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:43,590
on Annemette with a renewed intensity.

1279
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:49,340
With tangled hands, we march up Market Street.
We are several lengths behind Annemette and

1280
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:54,140
Nik, though they are moving at a snail’s
pace—Annemette has yet to see much of the

1281
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:58,300
town outside of the festival, and she’s
poking in every doorway and picture window

1282
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:03,870
to see the wares. The sweetshop man already
handed her a lollipop, which proceeded to

1283
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:09,350
turn her tongue a grisly shade of red. She
dared to show us a block back, sticking out

1284
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:14,810
her tongue nearly down to her chin. It was
quite the picture, a bloody maw beneath the

1285
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:21,200
face of an angel. Of course, she thought it
was the funniest thing. I thanked Urda that

1286
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,750
Malvina wasn’t around to see it.

1287
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:29,840
Nik laughed too, endearment written all over
his face. He has no idea how far she’s traveled

1288
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:35,010
to see these things we walk past every day,
to stroll down the street with him.

1289
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:41,400
“I have been to Odense,” Iker starts,
sun lines crinkling around his eyes, “and

1290
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:47,170
it isn’t Copenhagen, but it isn’t a one-horse
village either. By the way she responded to

1291
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:51,420
the sucker, you’d suppose she’d never
had a candy in all her life.”

1292
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:56,880
“Showing delight isn’t a crime, Iker.”
And it isn’t, though I know that answer

1293
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,790
won’t atone for Annemette’s fierce sense
of wonder. Thus, I turn it back on him. “Not

1294
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:08,150
everyone is as difficult to amuse as the salt-worn
prince of Rigeby Bay.”

1295
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:13,560
His lips turn up and his eyes flash my way.
“I laugh deeper than anyone and you know

1296
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:18,570
it—whether I’ve lived on only salt herring
for three weeks or not.” His fingers squeeze

1297
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:25,180
mine and I kiss his shoulder. “What I mean
is, there’s just something unnatural about

1298
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,430
her level of delight.”

1299
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:33,700
My heart starts to pound and my temples grow
hot. This line of thought is no good. No good

1300
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,240
at all. I change tactics.

1301
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:42,240
“Imagine it her way.” I sweep my free
hand out in front of him. “She arrived at

1302
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:48,720
Havnestad with a chaperone green with illness,
knowing not a single other soul. And despite

1303
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:53,860
it all, she’s been taken in, given a bed
in a beautiful palace, and the dashing prince

1304
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:58,050
she’s come to meet clearly believes her
to be something special.” I swing up our

1305
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:04,380
tangled hands so they’re within view. “That
is a whirlwind of delight, is it not? The

1306
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:08,820
curl was nearly blown out of my hair just
by being a bystander.”

1307
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:13,700
He gives me a courtesy laugh and snags a wayward
lock of hair with his free hand, tugging it

1308
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:19,650
completely smooth. He lets it go and watches
as it bounces back into a spiral. “That

1309
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:24,540
would’ve been disastrous. Even the salons
of Paris would not have been able to reproduce

1310
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:26,000
these.”

1311
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,150
My cheeks run scarlet as we reach the end
of the cobblestones and the trailhead of Lille

1312
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:36,600
Bjerg Pass. Annemette and Nik have already
disappeared around a bend. I step in front

1313
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,420
of Iker onto the single track, and our hands
drop.

1314
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:45,531
“I’m just saying,” he says, “what
do we know about Annemette? How do we know

1315
01:50:45,531 --> 01:50:47,350
she is who she says she is?”

1316
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:53,240
I laugh, trying to make it seem as if he’s
being ridiculous, and not appropriately concerned.

1317
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:58,480
“What, do you think she’s some con artist
on the run, stealing crown jewels one Lithasblot

1318
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:03,880
at a time?” It’s the most absurd thing
I can offer, except for the truth.

1319
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:10,100
“No. No. She’s a sweet girl . . . there’s
just something about her I can’t put my

1320
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,380
finger on. And I don’t like that feeling—especially
when it involves family.”

1321
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:19,650
“I know what it is,” I say, hoping to
finally put this to rest—for Annemette as

1322
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:23,420
much as for myself. “She looks like Anna.”

1323
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:27,580
His step hesitates behind me. “Your friend
who drowned?”

1324
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,300
“The very one.”

1325
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,590
“Sure. She had blond hair.”

1326
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:38,620
“Yes. And blue eyes. And creamy skin. A
heart-shaped face—all of it. The resemblance

1327
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:45,570
about bowled me over.” And I can’t help
it: tears well in my eyes. “I’d thought

1328
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:48,250
I’d seen a ghost.”

1329
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:53,950
He stops moving forward. I turn around and
he’s watching me, brows pulled together

1330
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:59,950
and serious. It’s just as he was on the
balcony, suspicion slinking across his skin

1331
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:02,270
as fierce as the sunlight.

1332
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:07,120
“Are you sure there’s no way this girl
could have known that? Picked the name Annemette

1333
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:12,710
on purpose? She could be preying on the both
of you—using your memories against you.”

1334
01:52:12,710 --> 01:52:17,110
The slope of the trail puts us face-to-face,
and he presses his thumbs to the corners of

1335
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:24,131
my eyes, wiping away the tears that have welled.
I place my hand on his chest. “Who are these

1336
01:52:24,131 --> 01:52:29,800
scoundrels you meet on the high seas? Does
anyone in the world really do such awful things?

1337
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,840
Do you not have any faith in your fellow man?”

1338
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:38,050
“Evelyn, I am aware that you are not naïve,
but I feel as if I should remind both you

1339
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:42,330
and my cousin that people aren’t always
who they say they are.”

1340
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:48,030
“You’re not wrong.” I take a step toward
him and touch my forehead to his, our lips

1341
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:53,540
a breath away, our eyes locked. “And while
I find your concern incredibly endearing,

1342
01:52:53,540 --> 01:53:00,410
I’m through talking about this. Annemette
may not be Anna, but she is my friend. I have

1343
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:02,510
not been duped.”

1344
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:09,090
I close the distance between us, our lips
meeting. He sinks deeply into me, hands wrapping

1345
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:15,320
around my back, fingers in my hair. We stand
like that for several moments, but it isn’t

1346
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:20,860
until he’s so taken he closes his eyes that
I know I’ve finally won this round.

1347
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:23,670
“Taking the long way up the mountain?”

1348
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:29,590
I push away from Iker and see Annemette standing
a few feet from us, Nik surely around the

1349
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:34,370
bend. Her brow is raised, but there’s a
smirk on her black cherry–stained mouth.

1350
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:42,140
“Haven’t you heard? I’m never on time.”
He grins a bit at his own self-effacing jab,

1351
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:47,670
but I swear I still see a skeptical look in
his eyes as he stalks past her.

1352
01:53:47,670 --> 01:53:52,770
Annemette grabs my hands, and we both burst
out laughing. It really does feel like Anna

1353
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:53,960
is here.

1354
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:59,170
We make our way up to the games, but by the
time we reach them, Nik and Iker have already

1355
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:05,710
been plied into competing in the mountain
run portion of the games. Royal duty and gamesmanship

1356
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:11,820
mean Annemette and I have been left behind
to hold court on a fallen log. Normally, I’d

1357
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:16,800
run too—I’m swifter than I look—but
Annemette’s feet are already bothering her,

1358
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:22,270
the burning she felt yesterday more painful
than before. Instead, we’ll watch the rock

1359
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:27,080
climbers from afar while waiting for the boys
to rumble back down the mountain, sweaty,

1360
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,720
dusty, and full of new tales.

1361
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:32,890
“How do you do it?” she asks quietly.

1362
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:35,610
“What do you mean?” I reply.

1363
01:54:35,610 --> 01:54:41,420
“Get Iker to kiss you like that?” she
says with more than a hint of exasperation

1364
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:46,410
lining her voice. “It’s silly, but I was
watching you—”

1365
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:52,250
“For tips?” I want to laugh—the idea
of someone watching me for my alluring abilities

1366
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:56,590
is ridiculous, and I still have my doubts
about whether there’s actually any love

1367
01:54:56,590 --> 01:55:02,920
behind Iker’s kisses, but Annemette seems
so desperate. She is desperate.

1368
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:07,960
Annemette’s cheeks flush, though the pink
is tempered by the mountain light. “I’ve

1369
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:13,900
done everything I can to show him how I feel,
and still no kiss! But I do think he likes

1370
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:14,900
me.”

1371
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:21,050
“He does. I know he does!” I push this
morning out of my mind entirely. Nik has heeded

1372
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:25,890
my words. I know it. It’s going to be all
right.

1373
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:32,490
She is quiet for a second, her features mellowing
with thought. “My father, the sea king,

1374
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:37,740
says that when everything is as you hoped,
you are blind to the imperfections.”

1375
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:44,610
Somehow, I’m stunned silent that the sea
king in our childhood tales is as real as

1376
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:49,970
the mermaid before me. Finally, I nod. “Your
father is wise.”

1377
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:56,280
“But I’m not blind. His wise words ring
in my ears when I should be enjoying every

1378
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:02,700
moment. Instead, I look past the perfect couple
we are on the outside and see all the reasons

1379
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:05,030
why Nik isn’t in love with me.”

1380
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:08,460
“I know what you mean,” I say.

1381
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,590
“No, Iker loves you.”

1382
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:16,040
I shake my head. “I would like Iker to love
me. But Iker has a reputation for kissing

1383
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:20,340
any girl whose knees go weak at the sight
of him—and I’m not the only one in the

1384
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:26,190
Øresund Kingdoms with trouble standing. Iker
and I are not forever, and I’m trying to

1385
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:28,110
be all right with that.”

1386
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:33,550
She looks at her feet. “So, he has other
girls he treats like you?”

1387
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:41,460
“Yes. Or he did. I don’t know.” I can
feel my face flushing. “The point is, Nik

1388
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,390
does not! There is only one fish in his sea
and it is you . . .”

1389
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,780
“That is a ridiculous analogy, Evie.”

1390
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:51,380
“And here I thought it was clever, given
your situation.”

1391
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:59,160
Annemette squeezes her eyes shut, and I regret
making a stupid joke at a time like this.

1392
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:07,220
“My situation. Yes.” She huffs out a sad
little laugh. “Such a situation—love at

1393
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:11,780
first sight with a boy who won’t even kiss
me. I was so sure he was going to lead to

1394
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:15,210
a lifetime of happiness, not . . .”

1395
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:21,450
Neither of us wants to say what her life will
be otherwise.

1396
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:27,790
18
WHEN NIK AND IKER RETURN, THEY ARE EAGER TO

1397
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:33,590
prove who is the strongest, the fastest, the
most agile, their egos sorely bruised after

1398
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:39,190
both losing the mountain run. It seems the
tailor’s son, little Johan Olsen, is not

1399
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:40,550
so little anymore.

1400
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:45,650
“I’ve never seen someone run like him,”
Nik admits as we make our way over to the

1401
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:50,650
Havnestad River, which slices through the
mountains before emptying to the sea. “It

1402
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:52,220
was a sight to see.”

1403
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:57,400
“You want to see a sight?” says Iker.
“Challenge me to a log run, Cousin. I could

1404
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:00,110
beat ten of that Olsen boy, and you, too.”

1405
01:58:00,110 --> 01:58:05,540
I look over at Annemette, who has plastered
a smile on her face and is laughing along

1406
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:12,030
with the boys. And, because I’d love to
see Iker dunked in the Havnestad River, I

1407
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:14,290
am totally encouraging it too.

1408
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:21,280
Nik chuckles—a royal chuckle, but an actual
chuckle nonetheless. As we reach the riverbank,

1409
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:26,240
he’s still contemplating. He props one foot
up on the tail end of the right log. There’s

1410
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:29,050
an open one to his left, ready for Iker.

1411
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:35,470
“If I’m not mistaken,” Nik says, “I
heard you came to this Lithasblot extravaganza

1412
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:40,260
with the promise of a certain raven-haired
girl scampering across a log, and it wasn’t

1413
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:41,270
me, Cousin.”

1414
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:49,280
Nik! How could he? But I laugh an Iker laugh,
head thrown toward the sky. Nik is losing

1415
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:53,800
it too—chortling so hard that his foot has
slipped off the end of the log and he’s

1416
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,030
nearly squatted to a sit on the thing.

1417
01:58:56,030 --> 01:59:01,530
Annemette, though, has her wits about her.
I right myself just as she glances my way

1418
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:09,880
with a wicked little grin and a gleam in her
eyes. “How about this compromise? Nik and

1419
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:12,300
Evie race. The winner faces Iker.”

1420
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:18,190
Iker’s brows climb his forehead and his
eyes sparkle, clear and thrilled. He claps

1421
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:25,880
his big, strong hands together. “Yes. That’s
it. The lady has the perfect idea!”

1422
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:31,160
I shake my head. “Yes, the perfect idea
to keep herself dry.”

1423
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:35,830
Annemette shrugs and backs into the small
crowd that has gathered, lined along the rocks

1424
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:39,600
and logs. “I’m just a spectator.”

1425
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:44,020
Nik laughs and manages a long lunge to nudge
her sweetly with his elbow. “That’s what

1426
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:48,020
I thought, too, my dear, and now look where
it’s got me.”

1427
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:52,600
I cock a brow at him. “Yes, as my first
victim.”

1428
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:59,800
“Hey, now, what makes you so sure you’ll
win?” Nik says to me, a smile playing at

1429
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,700
his lips, though his tone is attempting to
sound indignant.

1430
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:10,240
“Sometimes you just have a feeling, my prince.
You’re sure to be a loser, Asger Niklas

1431
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,470
Bryniulf Øldenburg III.”

1432
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:17,470
As the spectators and competitors chant Nik’s
name, he plants a foot on the log across from

1433
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:23,270
me. Both logs are suspended just above the
current, tied by ship ropes on either side

1434
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:29,610
to keep them straight and somewhat steady—to
keep the competition fair, not to create ease.

1435
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:34,781
It is twenty-five feet from one end to the
other. We must race to the other side, touch

1436
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:40,380
the bank, and then make a return trip. The
first one back or the one to stay out of the

1437
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:47,530
water wins. If we both wind up in the river,
then it’s a draw, no matter who fell first.

1438
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:53,850
Our classmate, Ruyven Van Horn, squashed ginger
hair, elephant ears and all, is there between

1439
02:00:53,850 --> 02:01:01,110
us, the official start on his lips. “On
your marks . . . get set . . . go!”

1440
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:07,080
We lunge onto the logs. Nik’s legs are much
longer, and he’s ahead after a step, but

1441
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:10,760
his center of gravity is much higher, and
he immediately wobbles.

1442
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:16,180
“Unsteady so soon, Cousin?” Iker laughs
in the background.

1443
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:21,950
I can’t see him, but I’m sure Nik is smiling
right back. “Jeer me, and you only serve

1444
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:23,930
to anger me.”

1445
02:01:23,930 --> 02:01:28,310
In the time it’s taken him to steady himself
and answer Iker’s ribbing, I’ve already

1446
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:35,250
made it five steps. The logs are slicked over,
but mine is the perfect size for my feet.

1447
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:40,060
Planting each foot in a turnout à la the
French ballet, I can move quickly to the center

1448
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:46,460
point with shallow steps. Beside me, Nik hasn’t
altered his stride, daring gravity to take

1449
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:51,220
him with every long step, but using his strength
and coordination to stay steady.

1450
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:56,150
I make it to the end of my log and tag the
ground on the other side, earning me a flag

1451
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:58,780
raise from Ruyven’s counterpart.

1452
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:02,460
“Excellent, Evie!” Annemette cheers.

1453
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:07,800
I get both feet back onto my log just as Nik
lunges off the end of his and safely into

1454
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:08,800
the dirt.

1455
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:15,640
“Mette, you traitor,” Nik yells, mounting
his log a bit too quickly. His arms windmill

1456
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:19,680
through my periphery in a grand arc—the
crowd gasps.

1457
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:24,340
“Less jawing, more movement, Cousin. Evie’s
smoking you!”

1458
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:28,350
“You only root for me because you’re stupid
enough to think you can beat me in the next

1459
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:32,260
round. Against her you won’t have a chance,
and you know it.”

1460
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:38,800
I’m still in the lead but just barely, my
steps slower and more careful now. Over the

1461
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:43,840
years, I’ve seen many a competitor fall
in the river a yard from the finish because

1462
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:49,150
his mind was already on land. I could easily
whisper one of Tante Hansa’s spells and

1463
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:55,530
dry the log without any notice, but I won’t
do that. I’m not a cheat. So my heart stills

1464
02:02:55,530 --> 02:03:00,550
as I concentrate on the log before me, the
sound of rushing water the only thing in my

1465
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:02,260
ears.

1466
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:07,590
Nik is beside me, but my tunnel vision has
drowned him out—if his arms are flailing

1467
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:14,150
or if he is steady and slowing too, I don’t
know. All I know is that when I touch dirt,

1468
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:19,860
Ruyven raises my arm, and when I look over,
Nik is there too, hands on his hips, breathing

1469
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:21,490
at a good clip.

1470
02:03:21,490 --> 02:03:28,641
“The lady, by an inch!” Ruyven says. Annemette
is clapping and Iker, too, though his game

1471
02:03:28,641 --> 02:03:34,770
face is already sliding into place. The rest
of the crowd is mostly silent until Nik raises

1472
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:38,740
his hands above his head in thanks—then
they go wild.

1473
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:45,230
“Well done, Evie.” Nik squeezes my shoulder.
Then he leans in, for my ears only. “Ignore

1474
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:51,031
them. They only cheer because they have to.”
Then, to the crowd, he says, “Let’s hear

1475
02:03:51,031 --> 02:03:53,490
it for Evie!”

1476
02:03:53,490 --> 02:04:01,040
Slightly heartier applause chases his exclamation,
but—not shockingly—also some boos. And

1477
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:07,130
then all eyes swing to Iker. His gaze is locked
on my face, the glee in the blue of his eyes

1478
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:12,340
already hardening to concentration. If Iker
competes in the grand way that he does everything

1479
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:16,200
else, I’m going to need much more than an
inch.

1480
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:18,380
I turn and place my foot on the log.

1481
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:23,400
“Are you sure you’re ready to exert yourself
again so quickly, Evelyn?”

1482
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:26,130
“Quit stalling, Romeo. Let’s go.”

1483
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:31,940
I glance over to Ruyven, who is having a fine
time laughing at our expense. Ruyven meets

1484
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:37,980
my eyes, his normally dough-pale face now
plum red, and raises his flag for a start.

1485
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:43,670
Iker is still a step or two away from his
log, turned around, playing to the crowd.

1486
02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:47,920
I settle my footing, calf muscles tense beneath
my dress.

1487
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:55,360
“On your marks . . .” It takes Iker almost
a second too long to register the words. Ruyven

1488
02:04:55,360 --> 02:05:00,590
is onto the next part before the crown prince
of Rigeby Bay has time to turn. “Get set

1489
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:02,970
. . .” Iker is a yard from his log. “Go!”

1490
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:11,010
I dash onto my log, keeping my chest low,
hips square and knees bent. I’m five feet

1491
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:16,239
in front when Iker finally mounts his log,
but in true Iker form, he takes the lead with

1492
02:05:16,239 --> 02:05:18,739
just two grand steps.

1493
02:05:18,739 --> 02:05:23,510
The surrounding wood is alive with voices,
so strong that they rise above my concentration

1494
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:29,140
and the babbling of the stream—Iker is always
one to bring out the rowdiness in any situation.

1495
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:33,090
“Go get him!” Annemette yells.

1496
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:36,270
“You’ve got this, Evie!” Nik cheers.

1497
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:42,440
But I don’t have it. Iker is already a yard
from touching down on the other side of the

1498
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:48,960
log, his bold steps risky but not without
reward. I am still at least ten careful steps

1499
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:54,860
from the bank and the chance to turn around.
When Iker’s feet hit the dirt, he immediately

1500
02:05:54,860 --> 02:06:00,670
spins and points to the flagman on the other
side and then raises his arms, grand and proud

1501
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:02,290
as he addresses the crowd.

1502
02:06:02,290 --> 02:06:07,780
“Will no one cheer for the first-place horse?
Am I so hideous?”

1503
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:17,070
At this, every girl in the crowd, save Annemette,
screams his name.
